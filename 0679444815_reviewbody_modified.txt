I got excited when I first read about this book The idea of a writer like Crichton taking a stab at time travel sounded promising   began well, too By the end of chapter one I felt confident I was  for a thinking person's trek into the science-meets-sci-fi--meets-history universe that was going to deliver an intelligent sort of thrillerbr br Nope This book was a letdown of hard-hitting proportions What started out as a scientific overview of how science might conquer time as easily as  has made headways into space, de-evolved into an adventure novel,  a poor one at that Crichton threw  everything but the kitchen sink  he irretrievably lost me somewhere about the middle point of this sloppy book Who was doing what, when where  why? I had no idea I read on hoping I'd gain a fingerhold  make sense of the sword fights  rescue missions that had somewhere along the way replaced my study  cultural differences between two widely-separated centuries Gone was the believable  interesting beginning with its secret labs  discussions of clothing, behavior  attitudes of the 14th century I was disappointedbr br I did finish this novel but I felt robbed of the book I thought I was getting  was Mr Crichton's work, he was entitled to take   whatever direction he saw fit, but as the reader, I have to say here, I think he made a mistake of mighty scope  changing plotline  mid-book
I'm not interested  the future I'm interested  the future of the future br - Robert Doninger, 1996 br   you don't know history, you don't know anything br - Edward Johnston, 1990 br -  br Where blood thirsty crazy lords who want to find out secret passages  will go to any lengths to find out, pretty ladies who skip from one person to the other where burning carcasses of horses  people's heads are thrown over into forts during siegesTimeline just keeps you interested till the end Which is significant of Michael Crichton's other books like Jurassic Park br   After a group of intrepid archaeologists {not explorers no} find themselves transported into fourteenth century feudal France trying to rescue their Professor after he had been back there too long They face all of the above mentioned problems  many more  br Crichton weaves an expert story involving the most modern technologies of day like quantum physics  some confusing stuff like multiverses with fourteenth century France  's incredible people [barbarians more like] br     then there is Doninger, ITC's brilliant manager who is the main villain, of the present He is responsible for making the machines that take Andre, Chris  Kate back to that world At the end of 36 hours [the time limit  which our heroes have to get back with the professor] we have a predicted twist  the storyline which, maybe was to be expected of that particular person br         On the whole the book was an enchanting read with 's dose of action  suspense  the pretty little lady thrown  Good job Michael!!
I found this book fascinating  informative   stays true to the Crichton style  I found the history very interesting as well as his theories of time travel vs demension travel (the trick with the lights works, by the way)  As many readers challenge the scientific ideas behind this  other Crichton novels, I think  is important to point out the same comments were made toward Wells  This novel is full of free thinking  provocative ideas  Simply wonderful!
A cutting-edge tech company  the New Mexico desert has discovered how to use quantum physics to teleport people, not from one place to another, but from one *time* to another Of course there are a few bugs still to be worked out,  there have been a few accidents, but the money-making potential is great But there is also a great danger  the potential to affect the past,  great care must be takenbr br  Part of the company's strategy involves funding an archaeology dig site  France, where a fourteenth century excavation is taking place When the professor  charge is called to visit company headquarters, his assistants make an astonishing find  the excavation: a note from the professor from the fourteenth century! Soon thereafter, the company comes requesting their help to rescue the professor, who has become stranded  time Once back  time, the dangers become immediately apparent  very real,  their own return home becomes doubtfulbr br  While the technology isn't nearly as believable ( even understandable) as some of Mr Crichton's other books (such as Jurassic Park,  Prey), this book is nevertheless a great adventure  while the continuous &quot;out of the frying pan into the fire&quot; situations might be a bit of a stretch,  was still a lot of fun to read I especially liked the great picture presented of what  might have been like to live during that time,  I'll assume that 's fairly accurate  well-researched Overall, very interesting  a great page-turner One last bit: don't even bother with the movie!
 you enjoyed &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;  &quot;Sphere&quot; then chances are you'll enjoy this book as well  you haven't liked Crichton's earlier technology extrapolations, you probably won't like this one, for many of the same reasonsbr  As with many of his earlier works, Crichton takes an idea from the very edges of scientific possibility  attempts to predict a possible new technology This is Crichton's strength--his imagninative applications of extreme scientific theorybr  Unfortunately, all of his stories are then built around similar plot lines Typically, we have an wealthy eccentric developing this new technology  secret, hoping to use  to become even richer Introduce a small band of experts,  have something go wrong, trapping the experts  harm's waybr  Crichton's other weakness is his character development While the names  certain details may change,  often feels like he's using the same characters over  over again,  we never really see any meaningful character growth  his storiesbr  &quot;Timeline&quot; is another Crichton techno-thriller, the literary equivalent of a summer action movie Its a fun ride, as long as you aren't looking for a great deal of substance However,  you just want a fast, fun ride, this might fit the bill
This novel is a very easy action pack read After the first few chapters the pages seem to fly by with everything that is going on  is set  the middle ages with Knights  Castles  written  a very believable (historically acurate I think) manner I truly enjoyed this novel for all the challenges the main charecters had to overcome Unlike some other reviewers I do believe there was enough suspense to keep the novel moving a number of the main charecters are killed  the beginning  the main party gets split up I won't go into anymore detail  spoil the book for you I believe this is a very action packed fast paced intence book that you won't put down till the last page
The title of this review pretty much sums  up   doesn't matter  you're a history buff  's fiction!!!  You're supposed to lose yourself  the book  use your imagination  YES!!  There are some of us left that have an imagination I liked the book just as I like almost all of Crichton's books
I struggled a little with the first part of this book, finding  a bit slow  technical However the action really hots up when 'we' reach the Dordogne region of France  the mid 1300'sbr  was exciting with engaging characters  plenty of twists  turns, keeping me glued to the story until the final pagebr Well worth a read
 belongs on the timeline of the best books ever written   is a phenomenal, thrilling, suspenseful  absorbing piece of historical fiction  's disgusting how horridly underrated this novel is   has everything: comedy, romance, action, adventure, science fiction - what more do you want?  Once again, master suspense novelist Crichton uses his power for keeping you 100% intrigued; he explains the technology so flawlessly, 's as  he were there  TIMELINE is historical adventure fiction at 's absolute best,  is undoubtedly Michael Crichton's finest piece of work yet  Highly recommended - fans of the author won't be disappointed
This is Crichton's application of the Jurassic Park formula  the field of quantum physics  time travel, instead of dinosaur creation  A corporation discovers a stunning new technology, a group of characters gets trapped  the universe opened by technology (where they are both strangers  prey),  adventure ensues as they try to escape  For those who enjoy this sort of thing (high on tension, pace  detail-- this case more historical than scientific-- low on characterization  'literary'remarkable prose), this is one to enjoy  For others, 's a library loan at bestbr  a nutshell, the story concerns three graduate students who have been assisting their professor  mentor with an excavation  France  The group comes to believe that, somehow, the corporation has more information about the dig site than they do  The professor returns to the US to meet with the Machiavellian CEO,  the students don't hear from him again  until they uncover a 600-year-old parchment with the words &quot;HELP ME&quot;  The pace then kicks into overdrive as the students learn their mentor has been transported into 14th century France  that they must travel back to rescue him  How many of them will return home,  any?  Keep turning pages to find outbr Some criticisms now,  spoilers:br * The overall premise is horribly flawed  's explained that the technology is not really time travel at all, but transportation into another of endless, alternate universes (since quantum theory posits a 'multiverse')  Fine, but  the professor is sent into the past of _another_ universe, then how can his handwritten message reach the students  _this_ one?  ( the whole application of the technology, 's explained, is to enable an 'authentic' recreation of the past; but how can  be 'authentic'  its the past of another world?)br * There is far too much action once the students arrive  the alternate past  As soon as they arrive, they're attacked  apparently so that they can be separated  problems can develop  Then 's like all the author's research about jousting, swordplay, siege, etc (which does look very thorough) had to be crammed into their 37-hour stay  (They can only stay 37 hours; the chapter-headings are  countdown format)  For example,  seems that the female student, an architecture specialist, has to be chased into ceilings  rooftops so that the author  she can demonstrate their knowledge of medieval roof construction  (Again, this assumes the roofs of this alternate world were identical to our own)br * The takedown of the 'heartless CEO' is simply over the top  cruel  Instead of calling the cops  having the board vote him out, the 'good' executive transports him back to a village decimated by the Black Plague-- essence, murders him  I think we're supposed to feel a sense of poetic justice  Unfortunately, my sense was more of disgustbr  you're a fan of Crichton  time travel books, you'll probably enjoy this one  can knock  out  a weekend  long plane ride   not, you may want to see  the upcoming movie draws good reviews  go with that instead ( not), as the novel, with its pace  constant action, looks like 's always been a screenplay waiting to happen  Three starstacked  apparently so that they can be separated  problems can develop  Then 's like all the author's research about jousting, swordplay, siege, etc (which does look very thorough) had to be crammed into their 37-hour stay  (They can only stay 37 hours; the chapter-headings are  countdown format)  For example,  seems that the female student, an architecture specialist, has to be chased into ceilings  rooftops so that the author  she can demonstrate their knowledge of medieval roof construction  (Again, this assumes the roofs of this alternate world were identical to our own)BR* The takedown of the 'heartless CEO' is simply over the top  cruel  Instead of calling the cops  having the board vote him out, the 'good' executive transports him back to a village decimated by the Black Plague-- essence, murders him  I think we're supposed to feel a sense of poetic justice  Unfortunately, my sense was more of disgustbr  you're a fan of Crichton  time travel books, you'll probably enjoy this one  can knock  out  a weekend  long plane ride   not, you may want to see  the upcoming movie draws good reviews  go with that instead ( not), as the novel, with its pace  constant action, looks like 's always been a screenplay waiting to happen  Three stars
Timeline is one of the most intellectually inspired novels ever published Brilliantly written  heavily researched by Michael Crichton, author of Jurassic Park,  creator of the popular TV series ER, this book will simply not allow you to put  down  will grab you from the very first page,  never let goBRThe concept of Timeline is a classic Time travel has always fascinated man  is not going to stop now However, this is not your father's time travel thriller A brilliant team of engineers, funded by a multi-billionaire, creates the ultimate time machine This machine can transport three-dimensional objects through quantum time  space Any moment of the past can be made a reality for any willing, that is, any willing with enough money A daring group of historians travel back  time to witness history without a middleman  the process they discover the true meaning of a writer's \\"creative angle\\" The past is not what  used to be
I LOVED this book I cannot stress strongly enough how fantastic  is  moves so quickly from about 20 pages  until the end I've read  at least 5 times  never tire of  I typically don't read  find interesting anything this science fiction oriented but  is incredible By far the BEST Michael Crichton book ever I can't wait to go see the movie Even  they got desperate enough to cast Paul Walker
Timeline: Why 's goodbr  \\"Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory does not understand \\"   Michael Chrichton's Timeline, the immense figurative language  detail overwhelm the senses with such great effect that the reader feels heshe is  the bookBR A professor of an archeological dig becomes stuck  the fourteenth century,  his students must come to his rescue  During the journey they come over many obstacles mentally  physically so they can get back homeBR This setting  the story depicts the real place down to every detail except for the people going through time  All of the dates are true down to the minute, which really adds to the greatness of the bookBR When the reader reads this book they will feel what the character feels because the characters are made so well  The excellent protagonist characters really keep the reader wondering what they will do nextBR Chrichton's excellent complex plot keeps the readers waiting for the next piece of story  The pacing of the book is perfect, not too fast, not too slow  His excellent foreshadowing techniques keep the reader  line so they will not be lostBR The language of Timeline is somewhat difficult at times because of the Latin  Old French, which get  the way a bit  But all the Latin  French is translated for the reader so  is easy to understandBR All these elements of the story really set off the story  This book is given a three  a half This novel is definitely worth reading as far as books go  Timeline is a great book as long as the reader does not have too high an expectance of the book
THis book is exciting  fun   would not let me set  down
this book is one of his best works  i would recommend  to anyone who wants a book that keep them thinking on what will happen next this is the one  The action is great  the characters are awesome the choice he made for each one  how they act was perfect  just proves he knows what is doing when  comes to writting a great book I feel this is one of his best works to date
I don't read much Crichton With all of the corporate-greed-turns-technology-evil plots, they start to all feel the same I picked this one up at a Library book sale for a buck I was hoping for another 'Eaters of the dead', but  feels much more like Jurassic Park  really is a good book, though  starts out  a slightly confusing waybr  a testament to Crichton's character development skills, the first 32 pages of the books introduce us to a myriad of interesting characters that have bascically nothing to do with the actual story They do, however, provide an intriguing mystery that makes us want to read through all the quantum theory stuff to get to the story As such I won't tell you much about the story The story focuses on a group of archaeologists (some graduate students) who are working on a cluster dig on the Dordogne river  France Two castles, La Roque  Castelgard, lie on opposing sides of the river valley  the mid-14th century these two castles were the staging ground for a pretty typical dark ages private skirmish Caught  between the two are a mill (one of the few of its kind found)  a monastery When the dig team discovers some disturbing contaminations to the dig, one their sponsoring companies, ITC, enters Come on, its a Crichton, you didn't think you could escape big business, did you?br The body of the story is fast-paced but  gets a little redundant with all the captures  escapes The climax, which is a real blood pumper, is built feverishly with a mixture of plot-twisting suspense, race against time puzzles  good, old-fashioned 'I am going to die!' fear moments The finale kills the excitement by tagging on some obligatory corporate greed thing The epilogue, however, cleanses the palette of the bad taste with a nice sentimentbr 's a good read, plus you can impress your friends with all of the quantum theory you learned Regardless of the fact that understand absolutely none of 
Knights  ladies, action  suspense, science  history -- Crichton provides a perfect formula for a page-turner   even , by the end of the novel, I felt that there are many better ways I could have spent my time that week, I certainly enjoyed reading Timeline  often couldn't put  downbr Parts of the novel read like a James Bond film, especially when our hapless heroes who get sent back  time ( do they get sent across parallel universes?) are outfitted with 14th-century-style gadgets that will come  handy at just the right moment  Timeline's protagonists are quite naive, particularly for graduate students  professors, allowing them to get themselves into one mess after another  , of course, they have the perfect combination of physical  linguistic skills to get themselves right back out of trouble at the last possible secondonly to find themselves  an even worse predicamentbr Don't bother trying to scrutinize Crichton's science   is well researched  well presented, as is the history, but  the end the reader must simply trust the bold statement of one of the novel's characters: time paradoxes do not occur  Can this be why 20th century Americans can travel back to 14th century France  not carry civilization-destroying diseases with them?   are we to dig deeper when we learn that the plague hit France less than a year after our heroes left?  Plenty of questions come to mind that Crichton does not answer, but this is a novel to get lost   to spark your imagination, not to over-analyze  Anyway, you'll be too busy turning pages to worry about the subtleties of quantum physics  parallel universes
Until now, I've only been familiar with Michael Crichton's work through his movies I read Timeline  just 5 days (well, I do have to work you know) Very enjoyable Similar to the Jurassic Park journey but without the dinosaurs  set  southern France  the year 1357 during the 100 Years Warbr Three young historians are transported back to rescue their chief historian  project leader who has sent a cry for help from 1357 to the year 1999 They have only 37 hours to complete their mission  they can't returnbr  the beginning, Crichton sets you up, educates you on the basic principles of quantum physics  introduces you to the main players  this adventurous blend of science fiction  historical literature Some characters were less developed to me, particularly the ones sent on the journey However, the story's villain was portrayed well enough to hate This was Robert Doniger, the founder of the company ITC, which uses quantum energy to recreate genetics  DNA to transfer humans to the past Sometimes there are Transcription Errors,  sometimes people can't return at all Doniger seems only interested with money  power, naturallybr I enjoyed the story  am sure the movie will be just as entertaining 's an exciting  dangerous countdown Only 37 hours,  they can't return
ok, i may only be a 14 year old freshman  high school but this book just rocks  i love the way crichton intertwines all the history, science  everything else  an exciting plot  i've read other techno-thriller type books by clancy  other authors  this book trumps them ALL  i'm not gonna spoil the ending for you but its not as \\"predictable\\" as the other dude put  (me being a teen may play some part   :0 ) i had to read  all  one night 'cuz i just did not want to put  down  i had to know what happened next as a reference, i think its alot better than most of his other books go read this book now i'd give  10 stars  i could
I haven't yet seen the movie, but I can tell from the commercials that  is quite different from the book  Considering how long the book is, I was amazed to hear that  was going to become a movie  However, the commercials indicate far more than abbreviation - they indicate major plot changes  This is why I recommend you read  firstbr I am not generally a big fan of long novels, but this is an exception  _Timeline_ is one of those books that is nearly impossible to put down once you being reading  Written  the typical Crichton style with believeable characters (despite his typical extra-fictional storyline), this is one of those books you get caught up , as  you are a part of  yourselfbr I hope the movie doesn't destroy the story
Timeline is an adventure story through  through There is no deep philosophical plot, no super mystery to solve, just straight forward actionadventure for the most part This is both good  bad for the bookbr Like all Crichton novels (especially his sci-fi) novels, a good portion of the book is spent educating you on the way things work Fortunately, he's such a skillful writer that you don't mind  fact, he'll keep you turning pages almost as fast as during the action  this book, Crichton a unique spin on the whole time-travel idea that successfully removes the problem all other stories of this type have; the paradoxbr Unfortunately for some, the book isn't so much about time travel nor the actual time the characters end up going to, though Crichton devotes plenty of time about both  all really ends up being a backdrop for the characters to have an adventure But fortunately for the reader, 's an exciting one  a bit shallowbr One can't help but notice how the book seems to have been written with the intent on being transfered to a screenplay The structure is extremely cinematic,  hopefully that will mean the upcoming film will be more faithful than most Crichton adaptations especially since this story is so similar to Crichton's most famous work; Jurassic Park (with knights instead of dinosaurs)br All  all, I enjoyed the book   kept me turning pages quickly The end is less climactic than you may have come to expect from a Crichton novel, but about on par with any good action flick (ie Die Hard, etc)
 one word, Wonderful I was attached from page one until the very last page I am a Medieval studies major  college  found that Crichton was able to give a very good history lesson  this book, right down to the OldMiddle english spoken by the characters of the timeBRThe book starts with a group of college students excavating a medieval church when their professer dissappears  After a few days of him gone a note is found deep  the ancient church with the words \\"Help Me\\"  The writing is  their teachers handwriting  This is just the beginning  Soon these college kids  Medieval lovers get plunged into a world the think they know about but find that they are way off  Dont pass this book up I recommend  for anyone that is even remotly interested  the Middle Ages time period
Crichton has magnificently interweaved all aspcets of fiction, world history,  science into this brilliant book I was very impressed by the way that he fit everything together  actually had all of  make sense Even though  is partly science fiction,  was easily accepted as a possible reality He amazingly explained complex ideas  simple ways BRI am definitely recommending this book to others, because its just incredible

I run hot  cold on Michael Crichton  Many of his novels spend so much time with the technology of the story that I feel I'd be better off reading a college text  But this one does not fall  that category   could be  part that I'm a big historical novel fan  the time travel to France  the middle ages just really caught my attention  He has spent as much time  attention explaining what life was like as he often does explaining some arcane theory  Now I don't know  his depiction is accurate  quite honestly, I don't care because  sounds believable  is a great read  For those of you who read his novels for the technology, 's still there  Although I don't pretend to understand the technology behind this theory of time travel,  adds that aura of science that Crichton has become famous for    My star ratings:    One star - couldn't finish the book  Two stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping  scanning  Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection  search out other books by the author  Three stars - enjoyable read  Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection  Would judge other books by the author individually  Four stars - Liked the book  Would keep the book  would look for others by the same author  Five start - One of my all time favorites  Will get a copy  hardback to keep  will actively search out others by the same author
This book is painful, breaking-your-own-nose-by-slamming-your-head-into-the-corner-of-a-wall painful  Yes,  hurts that much  The real problem with this book is that you could basically write  yourself for all of its predictability  Oh, who could have EVER guessed that the dude really into midevil stuff would stay  the past??  the plot devicesso lame!  Grendades conveniently getting people stuck  the past, etc  you have ever stuck your hand directly into a fire  held  there for over 30 seconds, you probably have the endurance  willpower to make  through this book  Otherwise
I have read timeline up near 5 times  everytime I read this masterpiece I find something else I didn't catch when I read  the first time The characters are very well done  Michael Crichton fleshes them out nicely Timeline contains mystery, action,  a little of everything else  suits just about any type of reader The way Crichton writes is very detailed  paints a perfect picture of what exactly the characters are seeing, feeling,  experiancing The excitment of the chases through the woods flows straight into the reader  makes  feel like they are the ones being chased This is an excellent book that will find 's way into the hearts  bookshelves of anyone who reads 
I am an engineer  I love the deep detail that Crichton goes into  his techno-thrillersbr Timeline is much simpler  straight-forward than the Crichton novels I have read (that being almost all of them) Having just read the reviews for Prey,  seems that MC is trying to make  much simpler to adapt his books for the silver screenbr I read books to get the rich detail that you can't get from movies This book lacks that detail While Timeline is a good book that I enjoyed reading,  doesn't measure up to Crichton's other excellent novels
Clearly The best Michael Crichton book ever!  The combination of science  suspence is thilling  this book  Everytime he come out with a new novel,  is just better than the lastBR  I am a long time fan of his work  was still deeply impressed by how he states his thesis of &quot;Let laying things lie&quot; so clearly  this novelBR   fact, I was so delighted with the book that I had recomended  to my mother, an avid fantasy reader  She read   said herself that  was a great novel
Crichton must have gotten tired of writing this one  published   draft form   starts with a tremendous SF premise-- time travel back to the Middle Ages to track down a person who got &quot;lost&quot; back there-- but never fully delivers  Still worth reading ( still better than most stuff that gets published), but not Crichton at his best
This novel benefits from what may well be Crichton's greatest strength- his ability to create a fantastic premise that is grounded  enough real science to seem plausible   this case, the story centers largely on a company that has secretly perfected technologies ranging from quantum computing to time travel   is apparent that the author spent quite some time studying up on both quantum physics  the middle ages before penning this novel,   largely paid off even  some chapters feel more like university lectures than story developmentbr Unfortunately,  this case Crichton's attention to science doesn't make up for his lack of attention to story development  Characters feel too flat to inspire much empathy,  many of their motivations are difficult to understand  One plothole that I couldn't get past: the company  the center of the story has exclusive patents on quantum computers, universal translators,  a host of other high-tech trinkets (not to mention time machines) but somehow has managed to find itself  dire financial straits  Why not put one of their less secretive gadgets on the market  make a few billion more to spend on their more covert operations?br Arguably the weakest plot point is when we learn that the &quot;villain&quot; who runs the company has some kind of diabolical plan for getting rich with the time travel technology  What could  be?  Going back to the 1920's  investing  the stock market?  Murdering the parents of rivals before they are born?  The answer will make you groan with disappointment  I don't want to ruin the ending, but I'll say this much- 's not exactly a new concept for a Crichton novel
I think the book Timeline is a great book  is about a group of people who get asked to go back  time with some other scientists to see what people did  the 1700's Everything is going well until they get spotted  a few of the people are killed  you want to figure out what happens to the rest of the scientists you are going to have to read the book I would recommend this for people who like science ficton  for ages 12 to 15  does have a little bad language, otherwise  is a very good book
This strikes me as a book designed to cash  on his own popularity following the Jurassic Park novels 's poorly thought out, with characters who are insufficiently fleshed out,  a premise (multiple universes?) that's even more unbelievable than time travel 's full of baldly milked suspense,  the whole thing comprises 4 archaeologists trying to get together long enough to press a button to send them back to where they came from sounds boring? well, 's about as exciting  rewarding as watching grass grow  the obligatory obstacles that MC puts  their way are, this one gets lost then the other  then the 3rd  then the 1st one again wow talk about a roller coaster ride  slow-mo colour me bored
I found this book to be very interesting This book gave you a suspenseful adventure  the details of the scenes were very descriptive  vivid The book almost made you feel that you were part of the action Most of the plots made me think of \\"What's going to happen next?  what will they think about next?\\" that's how suspenseful the plots were The science part of the story about quantum computers  theories was the part that got me interested  the book As many may know that quantum computers are a thing of the future  has not been achieved to that level The history part of the book was also amazing  that Michael Crichton studied his topic very well just enough that  brings out the history part of the story Excellent book I would recommend  to anyone
Crichton has got to be one of the few authors ever to fully explain time travel You really have to comend him for that, even  there are a few holes  the explanation So while the physics is a little unbelievable, the history isn't, Although many times the character's lives are saved by movie-like events  fact, the whole book reads like a movie, but I have no problem with thatbr Also, this isn't for the light of stomach, as  is one of the most gory books I've ever read But truly enjoyable Don't miss 
sure - Crichton is going for big effects But by doing this he manages to raise interest for quantum physics  medivial european history at the same time No matter how illogical the plot is ( I KNOW how illogical real quantum physics can sound) -  catches your interest,  amazingly much of  may be close to reality!
I am beginning to fall  love with what is known as &quot;hard&quot; science fiction Hard science fiction is where authors base their science fiction novels on some facts of science The author gives you a tutor on quantom physics  this book  bases his time travel on very scientific knowledge Some of  is made up but some of  isn't I am beginning to enjoy science fiction writers who don't make up everything Crichton not only aim  this novel is to entertain you but to teach you not only science but some history as well When I read something that not only tries to entrain me but teach me a few things as well I walk away feeling like I didn't waste my time reading this novel When a writer teaches you science  histroy  an entertaining way that keeps your interest through the whole novel  opens up a new world for you to explore that you previously abandoned due to lack of interest I have great admiration for writers like this  want to thank them for a job well done
I've made all of my friends read this book I've read  so many times that my hardback copy is getting torn apart  They're finally making  into a movie that I've watched so many times over  my head while reading the book  I can't recommend this enough!
Michael Crichton's &quot;Timeline&quot; is a solid, genre-stretching effort from the author of &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;  Crichton is perhaps best known to readers as the author of several popular technothrillers wherein he weaves an enormous amount of research into a compelling narrative br Now Crichton takes us out of the laboratory  into the Middle Ages, courtesy of some well-known quirks of quantum physics  When a multi-disciplined group of experts on the medieval period discover a message requesting help  perfect modern English  ruins dating back to the 14th century, they embark upon a time-travelling adventure melding science fiction with historical literature  br The results are decidedly mixed   Crichton's twists are often telegraphed  his characters rarely rise above their archetypes  He displays a solid knowledge of the medieval period  quite ably explains the quantum mysteries  terms accessible to the layman  The tale itself is straight-ahead adventure of the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; stripe---this is fast-food fiction, not &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; br Still  all, Crichton's &quot;Timeline&quot; is like a terrific television show---'s fun, entertaining,  mildly informative to boot
I bought this excellent book a couple of years ago I am embarassed to admit  took me till a few days ago to start reading  However, when I finally took  off my bookshelf,  was read over two days  I was left thinking, &quot;This is dynamite!&quot; Crichton has a way of making you feel that you are right  the middle of the action yourself On this occasion the main locations are the premises of the time travel machinery constructors, &quot;ITC&quot;  France  the 14th century The only bit that I got stuck at was the detailed descriptions that Crichton comes away with from time to time (sorry, no pun intended)  particular the actual time travel process (he tells us that  isn't actually time travel  the HG Wells sense of the word, but quantum physics version that whisks you away to 14th century France  a parallel universe You lost me there Michael!)  the rumours are correct then the movie of the book is certain to happen Already Billy Connolly  Anna Friel have been touted for parts as professor Edwards  Lady Claire respectively  Ewan McGregor isn't busy at the point where casting begins, I would sign him up for the part of Chris Hughes, one of the heroic student group that undertakes the perilous journey back to France at the time of the hundred years war Timeline is a superb read from cover to cover Hughes  his group are sent back to rescue Edwards  get into all manner of scrapes as they endeavour to find the man The story is full of the regulation good guys  bad guys with the lead baddie wearing regulation black which will help the movie director no end! All  all a riveting read at the turn of every page  even supplys us all with a novel twist at the end More than that I won't say for obvious reasons Just let me finish by recomending this book to all of you that read this Mine was bought back  2000  the waiting area at Brisbane International Airport for the princely sum of A$ 1750 Money well spent Bring on the movie!
This was an excellent book with many plot turns that keep you guessing I rarely read books, but this I couldn't put down! The book is about a time machine that allows you to travel to the past  then something gos horribly wrong when one of the characters steps out  the world of old  gets trapped  the past The entire rest of the book is about the &quot;rescue mission,&quot; but the catch is they only have a limited amount of time to return to the present before they will all be trapped  the past for good!  was a very compelling book that made me want to constantly read the next chapter to find out what happens An excellent book that any action fan should enjoy
Michael Crichton has done  again: written an excellent book that keeps you hooked  is written almost as  he meant for  to be made into a movie   opens up with what would seem like a typical opening scene for a sci-fimystery movie  A man dressed strangely for the climate is found wandering  the desert, babbling nonsense  When he is examined at the hospital, things get even weirder  Soon you learn about ITC with its experimental technology  quantum mechanics  Flash over to an archaeological site  France, where historians are attempting to recreate a model of a former castle  town  Put this altogether with people who talk too much,  soon you've got quite a dilemma  More is revealed as the story goes on  Once you are transported back to medieval France, the action is almost non-stop  Thing turn sour at the present-day ITC laboratories as well  Action, suspense,  overall excitement encompass the remainder of the novel  There is almost never a dull moment  I would recommend this book to anyone, especially  you are interested  quantum technology  medieval times  All  all, an excellent realistic science fiction adventure

Imagine a time where knights  kings ruled lands of war  lands  great celebration  Picture the French castle of Castlegarde surrounded by forests  a river, bustling with people from around the countryside  Across the river is a mill bridge,  on the other side is a monastery: The Monastery St Mre  For Professor Johnson  his graduate students,  would be a dream come true to see this  Studying medieval times, the group was researching the French region of the Dordogne River when a bizarre change of events sends the students to a remote testing facility  New Mexico to try to help their troubled professor  Using a new  controversial technology, they travel to the medieval times of France, only to be trapped there with a war brewing  What will happen when the grad students  the professor try to get back home before they're all killed?  Read this excellent book by Michael Crichton to find out  I thought this was one of his best books so far,  I've read most of them   is fairly historically accurate  is very well researched on Crichton's part, making the story very believable   you want to have a good book to read, this is an excellent choice  I couldn't stop reading  once I started,  I sat  read for a few hours each weekend for a few weeks until  was done  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested  science fiction, fantasy,  medieval stories, with an accurate twist of fact
I have read almost every single Crichton novel to date  After I finish reading one I always say that Crichton could never outdo that  But, he always does  This book is the most fun I have had  a long time   is the best Crichton novel to date  I wonder  he will be able to outdo this  Perhaps I'm a little biased because I love studying Medieval Europe  The plot unfolds quickly  the characters are absorbing  This is no mere book   is art
This book has all the elements of the genius of Crichton  From adventure to drama, this book has  all  As the travlers go back, they learn new things that the just assumed  Crichton brings to light new ideas on old believed truths
This is an excellent thriller almost right from the get-go All of the scientific stuff probably lost about a third of the younger audience  the first couple pages but once the story begins  the characters are developed  becomes an all out rescue through time An amazing sense of how real this could actually be overtook me as I read every page wondering had NASA already tried this   failed so they let Crichton take a stab at  from the fictional angle He did on HECK of a job THis is a masterpiece to put up next to The Andromeda Strain (which has a movie that is being re-done) The Time Machine (Guy Pierce's new re-done flick),  maybe even Bradburry's Fahrenheit 451 (which is also being re-done, supposidly with Mel Gibson)BRThe only real problem I had, which I took off a star for, was the fact that too many of the phyisically demanding events didn't seem to fit together with these made-to-be superheroes  was too unrealistic  the fact that the characters where too strong  too dedicated almost to the point of the book having four Batpeople, all of the science stuff was made to be at least the least bit plausable but the characters' physics were overboard
Michael Crichton does  again His latest book, Timeline is just out of this world!  the story, a company finds out how to travel to other parallel universes  thus, back  time  the mean time, during an archeological dig, an employee accidently lets some information out about the site  cannot explain  The professor, Johnson, goes to the company  threatens them to let him go back  time He does so,  becomes lost  a thirteenth century world BRFour of his students are asked to go after him There, they much find him,  bring him back But when an accident destroys part of the time machine, they much fight for their survivalBRThis book was intense! Crichton does a great job at bringing the people back  the last minute,  the events that go on to stop them BRCrichton also does a great job with the people from the 20th century  their interactions with the 14th century people The life that they lead is brutal,  that is illistrated well This is also true science fiction Science + FictionBRThe only problem:  was written three years ago I'm starving for another book by Crichton!
The extravagant novel Timeline by Michael Crichton was an amazing display of how life was  the 1300s  Characters  the book are absolutly realistic  have to run for their lives for much of the book  Because they are architectshistorians, they have a good idea of where their surroundings are  when all of the wars  battles went on  I give  two thumbs up
Michael Crichton has done  again A book you want to stay up  read here we have historians working on a site  modern France through a new technologythey start an adventure which take sthem back to the 14th Centuary,  France to the very spot they were studying They learn they were wrong  their ideas of 14th centuary life Very cruel  edge of seat lifeSee what  is like to be a modern person trying to survive  during he 100 years war The technology for time travel is palusible  the historical facts appear right on target  A lot of research was conducted before this book was written!!! Do yourself a favorread 
I believe Crichton suffers from his own success  This book reads like  was put to print when  became &quot;good enough&quot;  The foreshadowing is blatant, the plot mechanisms are cliche  He even makes a huge obvious mistake - the characters are using earpieces to communicate, which also translate language into common-era English on the fly; the thing is, for a good portion of the second half of the book, the characters have turned off all their earpieces, but can STILL understand what the locals are saying, when just 12 hours ago, they could understand nothing without the earpieces!  There are other smaller time inconsistancies  This is just sloppy,  I think a lot of popular authors let their quality drop like this when they're pumping out a book  more a yearBRDespite all of this, the book was still enjoyable,  that's what saved its rating  Crichton at least understands reader attention span  interest
With about 50 pages to go, I gave up on this one, not caring what happened to any of the boring heroes  villains of this tedious, repititious workbr I love time travel science fiction, but even so, this book did little to excite me About all we learn about the inhabitants of fourteenth century France is that they were a bunch of vicious barbarians, albeit more advanced scientifically than we might have thought Otherwise, the parts of the book set  the past are a long  tiresome series of contrived near-disasters  escapes that eventually blend together to where they're indistinguishable The amoral executives of the scientific company set  the present day are stock action movie charactersbr This is not one of Michael Crichton's better efforts

This book was about what I expected  to be  The scientific explanations seemed to be reaching  some parts, but over all  was a great book  Deeply captavating  quickly read, this will bring out your interests  both quantum physics  history  Not as good as some of his others, but a recommended read
'Timeline' is a  story that is mainly about a team of scientists who travel back to the middle ages to rescue their professor br The best part of the story is that weaves fact with fiction -- I found facsinating the author's description of the physics of time travel  his insights into life  Medieval France br Unfortunately, the bulk of the plot revolves around the 'good guys' running away from the 'bad guys', with nothing much else of substance br Anyway I have read quite a few of Mr Crichton's books  I would rate this as average -- good for vacation reading  picking up a few tidbits about the physics of time travel  medieval life, but don't expect much more
Crichton has a habit of producing books that are either superb  utter rubbish  Timeline, though  has a premise of incredible potential, is uninspired  disappointing;  may even surpass Lost World  terms of dull heroes  unacceptable plot  By unacceptable, I mean that the reader is never able to completely suspend their disbelief  accept the situations the paper-chain characters find themselves   I was also sad to see Crichton contradict his eloquent explanations of time travel  Sphere - a book more enjoyable because the science was better explained  incorporatedbr  you had the power to go back  time, why go to France  the middle ages?  Why not find out who really killed Kennedy  examine the life of Jesus,  bring back a dinosaur  start some sort of Jurassic park oh, never mind
Another unique concept from Crichton's  unbelievable boddy of knowledge  When I started reading, I expected archeology  but was led into time travel Now, I have avoided time travel because  is usually phony  phony resounds throughout the whole story  's usually so concocked that the plot becomes a time traveler ieway out there  But this story is a 180 degree switch  The methodology was fantastic, almost believable,  why not?   seems plausible, possible  porttends the future  I could not  put  down   read all night because I had to participate  even by reading  not  person  I was sad,glad, mad when I finished Sad that  was all over; glad to have read ,  mad that  was longer  that I had read more slowly   is really a fantastic story
I like , but I think this one is a one you must read twice
Mc's newest book, Timeline, is Crichton at his very best! The story has plenty of good guys  bad guys, both   out of the fourtenth century, including Robert Doniger, Lord Oliver, Sir Robert DeKeere, the general medieval terror Doniger, the generally all-around jerk that owns ITC, is a brilliant physistBRLord Oliver is an egoistic warlord,  his servants, Sir Robert  Sir Guy are evil, our hero historians trapped  the fourteenth century must survive  This book makes you wonder: Is  possible to travel to the past?
Read ANY of Crichton's other books, including his mediocre collection of memoirs, &quot;Travels&quot; This book never gets off the ground as Sphere, Congo,  Jurassic Park did so quickly The plot  writing style are so different from normal Crichton work that I continually checked the front cover to make sure that I had not picked up another book of the same title by a different author  you read any of Crichton's other works  loved them, read them again  save yourself the money on this one I only decided to give this book 2 stars because I feel the Crichton deserves more, not to mention the fact that I don't give 1-star reviews
Bravo!BRThis book deserves a standing ovation!BRChrichton does  again by weaving an interesting tale of medieval culture with modern science This is a must read for sci-fi readers  history buffs alike
A truly desperate effort to pen one on space-time The first few chapters squeeze- some interesting theoretical-physics (pre-existing  proposed theories like quantum foam, dimensional interference etc) to set the base for a poor storyline  false hopes to sling-shot a then drawn-out medieval tale Crichton should stick with the pop genera
This was a terrific read up to the point where the archeologists actually travel to the 14th century  seems Crichton didn't really know what to do beyond that point, so decided to pile on a thick layer of medieval butchery  gore to compensate for a disintegrating plot Disappointingly,  was never explained why the inventors of the technology chose this particular time  place  France There was some muttering about Disneyworld for time travellers (can you spell Jurassic Park?) but this lack of a &quot;why&quot; made the book seem silly  the end
I think this is one of the best books written by Crichton, along with Airframe, Andromeda Strain  The Sphere With every book he writes, I learn new things  is as though I am getting an education on the subject The subject of the book may seem very ordinary at the very beginning: time-travel But the plot is very delicately designed  keeps you alert  actually time-travels you between the two worlds Great action, superb scientific knowledge
Very entertaining audio book   starts a little slow, but hits high gear  a hurry  Lloyd does a good job of narrirating  Buy , enjoy , I am sure  will be a movie some day, so read the book  listen to audio first  Crichton does adventure again with this one
I love stories about time travel  love the medieval period  I am not a Crichton fan (sorry Michael) but I loved this book  have recommended  to all my friends   had some nice twists  turns  the bad guy got   the end
I love sci-fi,  history This is a neat mix of both  particalar, I enjoy reading historical recreations that are as much as possible accurate This indeed seems to be one of those Its true that the plot does become typical Hollywood about half way through,  all of the good guys get what they want,  the bad guys are punished, but so what? This is good fun I read the thing  a day, after all That should tell you something
I enjoyed this book! Okay, a group of historians working for a techno-billionaire find out that there is a way to teleport across time to 14th Century France This is something they do to rescue their professor who was visiting the past  missed the bus back to 1999 Once you've gotten through the techno-babble (My biggest technical skill is dialing the phone, but I kind of understood what Crichton was talking about!), this becomes a huge swashbuckling adventure, full of gallantry, honor, violence  action!
This book is one of the best I have ever read  isn't a a scifi as I thought  would be, but  definately isn't dissapointing The description of the whole &quot;transportation process&quot; was understandable  I found myself nodding along  understanding Timeline is definately a five star book  as  says on the front cover &quot;Crichton delivers&quot;
Another made for a movie book I think Michael Crichton is getting lazy  doesn't want to bother turning yet another book into a screenplay so he seems to be starting with the screenplay  fleshing  out slightly to make a book MC's strengths have always been the science  the books  this is no exception You get a fairly good tutorial on quantum mechanics  how  might be used for time travel His weaknesses have always been the characters  on this one he is at his worst By the end of the book I really don't care  any of them make  back The characters are basically a rehash of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; The evil industrial genius  rich guy, the soulless technicians  the heroic academics The plot is also thin  fairly predictable I almost didn't bother to finish 
Bob Doniger is one of the richest men  the world  A brilliant physicist, he has accumulated his wealth through the start up  sell-off of several companies  ITC is his current machine, by which he is researching his next big money maker: discovering the pastbr For years ITC has been secretly developing a time traveling device through the use of quantum physics  However, this time travel is not what most of us think as conventional time travel  There is no past, there is not future  There are only an infinite number of parallel universes  These universes can be traveled to, through holes  the \\"quantum foam\\"br ITC also funds many historic sites throughout the world  Through these sites, Doniger hopes to build his future cash cow  People start to ask questions though,  ITC comes under some scrutinybr Professor Johnston is one of the people who start asking question  He is a historian trying to restore the many castles along the Dordonge River, along with some of his students  This site is of particular interest to ITC  he wants to know why  He travels to the ITC headquarters for some answers, but ends back up at the Dordonge  The only thing is, he's  one of the parallel time streamsbr Andre, Chris, Kate,  Stern are asked by ITC to travel to the same time stream  rescue Professor Johnston   is an operation full of risk  uncertainty,  they only have 37 hours to complete br Crichton once again uses his writing prowess to craft an entertaining novel  Like all of his novels,  is well researched  filled with information  I find  similar to watching McGuyver  Though 's there for entertainment factor, you actually learn a few things from 
Michael Crichton has finally hit the wall  Timeline is nothing except a tired rehash of his previous, better, books  From the mysteriously injured  disoriented man  the desert (yoink, Andromeda Strain) to the precocious 11-year-old baseball player delivering graduate-level lectures on quantum mechanics (yoink, Jurassic Park) to the entirely preposterous &quot;evil company with mysterious aims  high tech stuff&quot; (yoink, Jurassic Park) Crichton has plagarized his earlier work without so much as an ounce of regret  's painful to read Timeline because  compares so poorly with a truly entertaining read like Jurassic Park,  even mediocre works like Terminal Man, Andromeda Strain, Sphere,  Congo   you want to see a plot that's as obvious as a train  a tunnel, plot 'twists' that are depressingly foreshadowed (team physicist actually a big wiz!  wow!,a really agressive misinterpretation of science,  serious coherency issues, feel free to buy this book   you are actually interested  reading a cogent thriller, I'd suggest Crichton's earlier work  Timeline,  a nutshell, is a poorly-done hackjob, an artistic ripoff,  a major-league disapointment
This book was truly a page turner  The gimmick of the clock  the relentless pursuit of the intrepid grad students by black knights  other thugs made this a thrilling read  Any fan of time travel stories   medieval history will love this book  I have Two big beefs with the plot, however  First, the story didn't fit the conception of time travel  , as Gordon explains, time travelers are really jumping into parallel universes, why do their messages  other impacts show up  THIS universe  Second, I didn't really get  until the very end what the point of ITC's investment was:  to make money developing historically accurate theme parks  adjacent hotels  You've got to be kidding  I could think of a dozen better  less risky making money with a machine that could &quot;fax&quot; stuff (including explosives!)  people than using  to make a theme park historically accurate You could put Fed Ex, Northrop  United Airlines out of business just like that! I get  with the dinosaur theme park, but here  really makes no sense Oh well, its still a lot of fun
I bought Timeline as I waited for a flight out of New Orleans  I was all on my own, with no one to talk to,  the small selection of books  the Airport's departure lounge was nothing to write home about  Timeline was the only book that stood out on the shelf amongst the others, so I bought  I'm glad I didbr From the moment I started reading the story on the plane, I was hooked I could not put  down  Michael Crichton has the enviable ability of taking a complex subject (quantum physics),  making  accessible - especially to those of us who are still trying to figure out what all the buttons on the microwave are forbr  typical Michael Crichton style, the beginning of the story - a kind of prologue to the main story, introduces the reader to the effects of time travel - even though this does not become clear till later on  the story br The main characters are not deep  complicated  There isn't enough time for you to get into their psyche  You'll be too busy reading about what is happening to them, to be worried about what emotional baggage they are carrying  Besides, this is not that kind of bookbr  you like clear, concise writing, that is easily understood  takes you on an exciting journey without being pretentious  too clever, then this is the story for youbr After reading Timeline, you will see why Michael Crichton has become one of the world's best selling novelists
Una muy buena historia, con una gran cantidad de detalles tecnicos del presente, pasado (agradable sorpresa) y futuro de la ciencia, al ser un relato contado con tecnologa al borde de ser descubierta corre algunos riesgos, ya que algunos de sus conceptos menores(como la espuma quantica), han sido ya desechados en el mundo cientifico, de cualquier manera como todos los libros de Crichton (Jurassic Park y Congo son los mejores, 100% mas y mejor historia y escenas que las peliculas) la accin se desenvuelve a un gran ritmo y mantiene el interes en nosotros los lectores Las 4 estrellas son debido a que es un poco previsible al inicio y a que en general el motivo que desencadena toda la historia es un poco debil
This book will delight both historical  science fiction fans as  combines theoretical quantum physics with medieval history  A group of historians researching a site  France find out that the quantum research company that funds them knows more than them about the area than they do  The company has discovered a way to send someone to a different point  time; however, the professor of the historians has been trapped back during the Hundred Years' War  the area they are researching  They go through time to try to save him, but they find themselves trapped  the middle of a conflict during the Hundred Years' War  Because I really like history  nearly fanciful science, I really enjoyed this book   moved quickly  I found myself unable to put  down until I finished  The characterization was excellent - the characters were likeable  not too stereotypical  I especially liked the main character Marek who tried to emerse himself completely  the medieval era by learning martial arts like sword fighting  jousting because he reminds me of my fascination with medieval history  I only disliked that some portions of the novel seemed abruptly  overly violent  had too many gory details for my taste  However, overall I really liked the book   provided a more accurate image of the Middle Ages, showing them  a more positive fashion than they are usually viewed  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested  the Middle Ages  anyone who wants a fast-paced  interesting book
When the nineteenth century came to a close, many scientists believed that nothing more could be accomplished  science  you told them of all the discoveries they would make, many claims would seem unbelievable  would be dismissed But many more things were invented since then X-Rays were possible, moving images would be transmitted from satellites, bombs of unthinkable measure would wipe out entire cities at once,  vaccines would be created for viruses but the disease would fight back But here we are once again, at the end of the 20th century, the scientists may still believe that there isn't much more to discover but they no longer say so But a company called ITC discovered new breakthroughs  quantum technology br      The company has been trying to keep this technology a  secret,  so far  has been ITC has been able to transfer a  person from one universe to another There are an infinite  number of universes (according to the book)  they were able br to transfer objects (including people) into different universes    different time periods  this technological development  gets released to the public, then people will try to put an end  to the companybr      This story has a group of four people that must rescue a  missing professor, but apparently some details are being kept  from them The team of four has 37 hours to retrieve the  professor,  along the way they encounter squires  knights   sounds simple enough, until 10 minutes later,  the team ends up stranded Now, they can no longer call back their  transport machines, they don't know where the professor is,   a band of knights are after the team Meanwhile, the professor  has a reputation as some kind of a wizard The mission is more  complex now the clock is tickingbr      I like this book because  deals with universe hopping,  but universe hopping is almost like time traveling I like the  way this book deals with advanced computers, with knights from  medieval times,  how the people of today find recognizable  items from today that belong  the current time period, but  they can be dated back to the 1300's
Michael Crichton's writing was foreign to me until 'Timeline'  He kept me on the edge of my seat whether  was at home,  a cab  while I was flyingI could not wait to get to the next page of this adventure set centuries ago  France  He wraps  up with an ending that gives the reader closure with contentment  I have given this book as a gift  the recent past, I recommend  that much  Looking for a great adventure  time travel?  You found  with &quot;Timeline&quot;
Timeline is an intense race against the clock  is suspenseful  thilling  is plotted well enough  the pace is blistering What this book is not, is literature Moreover, anyone who reads a Michael Crichton book expecting literature needs to fault themselves  not the writerbr  this soon-to-be movie (one can only hope) a rag tag team of archeologists visit the 14th century  hopes of saving one of their own, who is unexpectedly trapped  the Middle Ages Unfortunately, they only have 37 hours to locate  rescue himbr  books about time travel  the Middle Ages interest you, be sure not to miss Timeline
Great Book   was up all night reading  I strongly reccomend this book
To start, this is my first Crichton book I have seen a number of his films: Sphere, The Lost World  Sphere Of those three, I found Sphere the most interesting br My thoughts about the book are mixed There were some parts that I found fascinating  some parts that I found tiresome br Positive Aspectsbr I confess that I am a history buff, so I liked the archeological dig  France  I liked some of the ideas there I wonder whether the field of &quot;experimental history,&quot; actually exists; I know there are historical recreations (eg US Civil War  USA  Roman Empire  Europe) but the idea of  as a University discipline is original, as far as I know The character of Doniger (more specifically, his speech near the end of the book  elsewhere) is notable for his ideas I wished that Crichton had furthered explored the corporate side of the story The quantum technology was interesting (Crichton's introduction helped  giving some background on this)  right now,  is so new that nobody knows what  can  cannot dobr The descriptions of the 14th century were very good   was obvious that Crichton had done some research here I was impressed to see a 4-page bibliography; this is the first novel that I have read that contains a bibliography Crichton notes some of the books that he found particularly useful; I may look up some of them for further reading  the futurebr Negative aspectsbr All of the main characters are late 20th century historians (albeit one of them trains with swords, jousts  other mediaeval practices) They all survive numerous fights with fourteenth century soldiers, knights who are not only much more experienced than they are but also more well armed  physically stronger I think  is implausible that these characters would survive so many times  battle  the characters had been  the royal court  had to survive to their wits, I think  would have made better sense The companythat provides the time travel company could have been more complex; some internal scheming  perhaps balance the absolute power of Doniger against another characterbr I quite liked the book; the constant warfare  bloodletting battles was quite a change from my usual reading  a little variety is good
This was really a page turner for me  I enjoyed the combination of history, time travel,  quantum physics
Once again, Michael Crichton has superbly masterminded a spellbinding book Not since Jurassic Park has such an enthrallin book come out of his repertoire! The thing people love so much about Crichton's books is that he is able to manipulate scientific knowledge  such a way that  fulfils his fictional fantasies  a way that, to those educated enough, actually appears feasible,  to those less educated, well,  appears as comprehensible as ancient Greek Not knowing the science behind the novel does not detract from the overall enjoyment of the book however, as the characters, transported back  time spend 37 hours running about 14th century France dodging the dangers of the 100 years war I thoroughly enjoyed the book  recommend  to all those who find science-fiction fascinating
For a good bit of Timeline, I thought I would end up rating  very highly  However, eventually all the flaws  the book added up to a mediocre novel  Regarding Crighton's explanation for time travel, at times he tries to go into excruciating detail but then glosses over some issues regarding time travel with absurd analogies, particularly about why a person going to the past can't have a strong affect on the course of history  Overall, I found the explanation for time travel inconsistent  unbelievable  I probably would have enjoyed the story more  Crighton had just written that the characters invented a time machine  left  at thatbr As far the main substance of the story, the adventures of the characters  the past, what I thought would be a story of intrigue with some action scenes thrown  quickly turned into a Schwarzenneger movie filled with one fateful coincidence after another  characters who seemingly can take plenty of damage but still run, jump,  fight with gusto  Falls of ten  more feet are nothing to these characters  Like any good action movie, the characters again  again escape a hail of projectile fire without being killed  Crighton takes pains to explain that fourteenth century people were a hardy, strong,  skilled folk, yet they constantly have trouble  combat with the main charactersbr This was my first,  last, Crighton novel
This is swashbuckling material Very much  a catagory where Crichton exells, the pace  momentum of this book simply do not allow the reader time to pause for breath Once again, we are bombarded by technical detail, once more we are taken on a stupendous ride through previously uncharted territory This is exactly the kind of reason why Michael Crichton is such a phenomenal writerbr The one thing that did strike me perhaps, is the fact that just like many movies  books of a similar adventurous nature, life  death are only guarenteed at the very last second ( this book, literally) Although I had a sense that this was perhaps going to be a liitle tired  used idea, this did not happen Quite the opposite  fact I read with intense anticipation, never totally sure whether  would be happness at the end  why? Because the book practically wrapped its huge talons around my neck  refused to relent until I had finished So taken with the twisting plot was I, that finishing the book was the most disappointing aspect of reading  ENOUGH SAID
Every now  then you come across a book where upon completion you comment to yourself that was fun to read but when you attempt to analyze why, you realize there is little critical justification Such was the case for me regarding TIMELINEbr br Crichton did what I found to be a credible job of outlining quantum theory to a novice like me, at least to the point I could except the premise His vivid descriptions of 14th century medieval France were interesting although at times the characters seemed to be lost  the background, which was just as well since little effort was spent  developmentbr br Overall, this book tended to drift from a somewhat cliched, time-travel sci-fi work to revisionist history of the Dark Agesbr br But, I liked  I just cannot explain why
Yet again, Crichton lets the science overshadow little things like plot, character development,  so forth  Mike, a word to the wise   I wanted to read a book on theoretical quantum physics, I would buy a book on theoretical quantum physics   I wanted to read a book on medieval history, I would buy a book on medieval history  When I read a fiction piece, I want to read about well-developed characters  a well-paced plot delivering believable dialogue  Three things this &quot;novel&quot; was completely lacking 
The best things Crichton wrote,  my opinion, are the jurassic books (Jurrasic Park &amp; The Lost World) The other books weren't that good but they were interesting enough, some of them better (Congo, Andromeda strain)  some worse (Disclosure, Airframe, Terminal Man) Timeline falls  the category of Congo andAndromeda Strain 's not great, but good I love history, so this was a bonus for me while reading  One of the things I love the most about Crichton is his imagination He allways thinks  writes about technologies that aren't exist But the beauty   is that 's not impossible,  maybe someday  will be common That makes him something like a modern Julles Verne, predicting the future Crichton makes  sound very realistic as  this book, when he describes time travel as a  possible technology The suspence  the book  the graet characters ad a lot of good qualities to the book The only problem is that there are not enough surprises  the plot
Some felt Crichton's takeoff was great but he crashed  burned after a 100 pages I disagree His book was not written to be a scientific journal on quantum mechanicsphysics nor an anthology on 14th century France Crichton's goal is to raise the same question he raised  Jurassic Park  is not a matter of &quot;could&quot; we do this but &quot;should&quot; we attempt this Some have criticized Crichton's statement that since multiuniverses exist  would be impossible to alter the future  the book the characters do alter the future but that is precisely his point  is a critique on such arrogance  we could travel back  time, who could resist the temptation to stay a neutral observer? The desire to know more  experience more from that time would inevitably lead one to alter events I learned a lot about that era as well as the science he addresses  some way Crichton demonstrates that humanity has not really matured through time We have simply developed better technology to feed  express our arrogant  narcisstic egos The scientists  the book argue they can &quot;control&quot; the forces they are utilizing but Crichton shows they cannot His book demonstrates that when given power, regardless  's  the 14th century  the 20th century, there are very few who will be responsible with  Like Adam  Eve  the garden,  was not enough just to see the fruit, they had to taste --thus altering their future as well as ours
Timeline is one of the greatest books I've read  years Crichton is my favorite author  his Timeline gave me great pleasure  reading This is an extremely complex book  only an intelligent writer like Crichton can pull  off Timeline takes you from the modern sciences of today's world to the past of the 1300's He did his research  explained  wellbr My only complaints is that at times,  seemed I was watching a cartoon Every five pages  so, there would be a new problem with sword fighting, fires,  diseases,  the characters would always make  out OK All the conflicts  the book add to the excitment but  is just way too much  hard to believebr But on the other hand, Crichton knows what he is talking about His bibliograpy is three pages longs He explains complex quantum physics simply to where one would not be hung up,  continue on the story He also shows his intelligence about the 14th century; including swordfighting techniques, castle architecture,  the languages I hated for this book to be over I wish  was twice as thick,  now we have to wait for the movie (I'm sure  will be a movie)
Joe Haschka's review hit the nail on the head Disjointed  pompous,  the characters are utter cyphers Blathering dreck with an incredibly disappointing ending What happens to Andre? We'll never know  &quot;the Professor&quot;? The one on Gilligan's island had more personality Dreadful
  this case, mileage-burner, since I listened to the tapes during my usual 40-minute commute to  from work A friend gave me the recording  I decided to try   consisted of four 2-hour tapes I'd listened to short sci-fi stories on tape before but had never tried a full-length novelbr   The person reading the book does a good job of doing the different voices  appears to have been &quot;voiced&quot; by a single actorreader who does everything 's not exactly like having a full-production with different actors but  was okay as is, as the person who did  is pretty good with the different voicesbr As a pleasant way to pass the time while driving  the car, you could do worse The basic premise of the story is that you can use some properties of quantum particles to travel between different worlds made possible by these different quantum dimensions  propertiesbr One of the scientist characters explains this is based on some speculation  research by Richard Feynman, the famous physicist  Nobel Laureate I am a little out of date with my physics, but what I do recall is a little different from the way  was explained  the story Feynman once showed mathematically that a positron could be explained as an electron moving backwards  time This doesn't mean this is how  works out  reality--merely that there is no mathematical problem  contradiction  describing  this waybr But back to the book Whatever the real explanation is, Crichton uses this quantum time-travel gimmick to take you on a swashbuckling adventure back to the midst of the Hundred Years War  France,  the mid-1300's This was a very dangerous time, where treachery  death seemed to lurk behind every castle  even monastery wall An important professor has disappeared back into this time,  a rescue party is dispatched to retrieve him One of the team is a modern archaeologist who is expert on the period  can even speak Middle English  French He has waited his whole life for a chance like this, but even he gets more than he bargained forbr I'm about 34 thru with the tapes so I don't know who  ends yet, but as a pleasant way to pass otherwise wasted commute time, this little historical thriller was better than most No doubt  will be made into a movieish  French He has waited his whole life for a chance like this, but even he gets more than he bargained for br I'm about 34 thru with the tapes so I don't know who  ends yet, but as a pleasant way to pass otherwise wasted commute time, this little historical thriller was better than most No doubt  will be made into a movie
This was the first Michael Crichton book I've read,  I can't wait to read another!  I would recommend this book for anyone who is a fan  interested  Sci-Fi  History  Action  This action packed thriller kept me thinking all day about the advanced technology  this book  how maybe someday  could happen Timeline was so interesting that I read   a couple of days! I couldn't put  down!  I have to warn some people though,  you are not familiar with some math  science, BEWARE, this book will make no sense to you
By this time, Michael Crichton is more of a screenwriter than a novelist - his books have odd lapses  character  plot that  any other novel would be fatal As you read his books, however, they can really come alive because of the cinematic quality that his writing has I expected all this when I picked up Timelinebr What I didn't expect was how quickly I would get sucked into  - the premise was crafted very well,  the initial conflict gets you hooked right away You like the characters  are rooting for them (even  htey are a little two-dimensional) While the ending is a little rushed ( too pat, to boot) 's not a huge disappointment,  you problably didn't notice since you were casting the movie  your head br Definitely an easy, entertaining read, with plenty of imagination-stirring detail
The concept is great, but I found this book to be pretty boring  The situations seemed contrived  the book reads like  was intended for an adolescent audience  Not up to the standards that Chrichton set with Andromeda Strain  others
Crichton has really done his homework  the setting  14th century France is brough to life for the reader  you can over look a few weak explinations about time travel  related issues that are not too convincing, you can really enjoy this book The pace is frantic  once  a while I heard myself even shouting to the characters as they constantly encounter one life threatening problem after another A classic cliff hanger
All of Michael Crichton's books have one thing  commonTime  you are looking for a read-- -one-night-page turneryou found   This one has something for everybody  Yes, the beginning does explain a little about science  Quantum Physics to help you understand the possibilities of playing with timebut even  Jurassic park that was a requirement I am no fan of science but I enjoyed the few pages devoted to thisbecause then you're off!!!  from modern day archaeology to Medievel times  All the characters are beleivable  real  The character Merikseems so quiet  the beginningbut just wait!!! He will shock the pants off you This book is an adventure  Thrills, chills,  suspenseespecially 34 throughyou can't stop the page turningThis is because every chapter is a watch ticking Literally   is a countdown  as time runs out you find  truly is Impossible to put this book down  My friend is a devoted Tom Clancy fanhe's just not an adventurous reader  I nagged him to read Timeline all yearhe finally did  LOVED !!!
Having been an avid reader of Crichton ever since Andromeda Strain, always hoping for another of that quality, always forlorn, I must say that of his several literary failures this is Crichton's worst The pseudo-time-travel framework works ( doesn't work) as a mere device to arrive at a 14th-century Perils of Pauline, with all sorts of ad hoc dangers strung together  avoided by ad hoc tricks  a linear plot ( you can call  that) that lacks tension  The main characters are stereotypical, neither likeable nor damnable, lacking color  credibility  The failure of the quantum-mechanics transport machinery  its Rube Goldberg repair become a flimsy sub-plot, hardly contributing to the story,  the ultimate fates of the entrepreneur  of the medievalist,  not inevitable, are less than satisfying Doniger is not evil enough to make his end one you can really feel is well-deserved, nor is Mareks character sufficiently wrought to lend joy to his decision  its consequence The &quot;countdown&quot; device utterly fails to lend dramatic tension  The problem was, halfway through the book I could no longer care whether the adventurers got back to the present  not:  they run out of time  get stuck  the hundred years' war, so what?
 you were to hand me a book about the middle ages before reading this novel, I probably wouldn't have given any thought to actually reading   Michael Crichton however has changed all that for me  His ability to bring the era to vivid life has peaked my curiosity  books both fiction  non-fiction about the era  When I first read the book I was looking forward to the scifi but about halfway through I was more interested  the ongoings  the Dorigone(sp?) valley  The scifi was a wonderful complement to a brilliant storybr I'd give the book 45 stars  I could
Crichton book, sci-fiction? Hmm well i gave  a try This book tells the story of time travelling How? Ofcourse with a time machine I never believed  time travelling but as always Crichton trows a lot of &quot;real&quot; information at you You almost get the feeling that time travelling is possible The story  this book is good but sometimes a little slow No doubt the  best part of the book is when a team goes back  time to save a dude stucked  time against evil knights you really like an adventure book read crichton's lost world 's better
This book is  fact some sort of a timeline  you start with reading , its so thrilling that you won't be able to stop reading until you've read the whole book I have read a lot of books of Michael Crichton  all of them are very very good But I would really say that the Timeline beats them all  could be descripted as the best book of Michael Crichton  you haven't already read , you'll be going to read !
I've never read any of Crichton's other works  As a matter of fact, I read this novel soley based on my love of history  I certainly wasn't disapointed  The concept is facinating; fax yourself to the past  the &quot;sliders&quot; multiple universe theory  While Crichton went a little far  depth with the technical aspect for some, to me  made the plot believeable  understandable  I rely heavily on logic  not understanding the concept of how  worked would have made me lose all interest  the associated plot The charachters were amicable but were moreso a vehicle for the plot to continue  You didn't necessarily worry that you're favorite charachter's head was going to get lopped off by the big green monster; but you were more worried how that would affect the others  whether they would get back safely  on time   was all about what was going to happen at the end This is a suspense novel with everyone  all different places  all sorts of things going wrong  You can't not turn the page, after one thing works itself out another goes wrong, pretty soon 's 12 AM  you're on page 300  just not able to stop  This is why Timeline is a fantastic display of literature  Despite the fact I read very quickly, this was a novel where I just couldn't read fast enough A few things, I couldn't help but bring up, I thought about after reading   you haven't read the book, despite that I try my hardest not to reveal anything, you may just want to stop reading here   the ear pieces were manufactured to disintegrate after a few weeks, why was  still functioning after so long?  Also, how could they have found what they did  the end  supposedly they had gone to another universe?  Wouldn't  exist on another universe  not that one? Other than those two errors, one somewhat explainable, the other entirely confusing, I loved the novel  greatly recommend  to others
Although you may not always agree with his ideas -  fact,  Lost World he seems to skewer some of the ideas presented  Jurassic Park as \\"trendy\\" - you'll always have a blast reading the book He's never afraid to throw at us new ideas, concepts,  information, challenging our notions of what we thought we knew Contrary to popular opinion, he shows us a vibrant, scary, energetic, intelligent Middle Ages - where people were just as smart, devious, screwed up,  dangerous,  often were stronger, healthier,  faster (much as Neanderthal Man had a bigger brain  incredibly strong musculature compared to \\"modern\\" man),  combat was fast  furious, not plodding knights slowly swinging unwieldy swords (See HACA for more on this)br His time travel method, though (as he admits) is squarely  the realm of fantasy, nevertheless captivates our imagination  although you may not much care for his characters (at least, the ones from our era - the medieval ones, especially minor characters, grow on you), you'll certainly be caught up  their predicaments
I think that since so much has already been written on the plot of this novel that instead I will focus on why you will like the book despite  being out of the ordinary for Crichton  The author has moved outside the box to write this exciting piece of science fiction which involves time travel from the present American Southwest to 1360s Dordogne River Valley  France  Suffice  to say that the plot moves extremely quickly given that a handful of modern scientists are challenged by situations for which they haven't been trained  While the characters may not be 10's on a scale of 1-10  how fleshed out they are, they are believable  we do care about what happens to them  The tome, while looking imposing, moves along at a rapid rate, making you wish the book were even longer This one is  my top five for the year Kudos to Crichton for trying something daring  different!
Crichton has once again produce a spectacular work of fiction based on cutting edge technology  This time  involves time travel, but not  the way we're used to  The protagonists are actually sent to a parallel dimension where  is actually the 14th century  They are trapped there  have to avoid many of the hazards of Medieval live before returning to the present  The novel is wonderfully written  keeps you wanting more all the time  Definitely the kind of book you could read during a blizzard  just when you don't want to leave the house!  Magnificent!
Michael Crichton's latest, &quot;Timeline&quot;, starts out slowly ( takes 163 pages for the gang to get where they are going), but once  gets started, its gangbusters all the way!  The basic idea is something like &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;--brilliant, but amoral tycoon  gang of fearless (okay somewhat fearless) young scientists  a world existing  the past  But next to &quot;Timeline&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; is a walk  the woodsbr The action begins as soon as our intrepid heroes reach their distination, France  the late 14th century during the 100 Year's War  Before they can say, where are we, a fiercesome bunch of medieval horsemen coming riding toward them swinging their swords  For the next 300 pages the action continues hot  heavy  Adventure, action, romance, intrigue, its all here  morebr Of course,  is all written with the movie  mind I see Sean Connerly as the professor  The toughest part to cast will be that of Kate, the young expert  architecture who has to get out of more scrapes than a Houdinibr The book is premised on the idea that a quantum computer can be build  that there are parallel universes to which people can travel  Crichton admits that this part may be far-fetched, but he also claims that the historical parts are factual  One thing is for sure, when you finish this book, you will be grateful you were not living back  those times
Timeline is a terrific book  Chrichton does a great job of teaching us all about time-travel  life  the 15th century  This book is exciting from the beginning  hard to put down  I think  ranks among Chrictons best novels, Jurassic Park  Lost World  Highly recomended
I have to concur entirely with the first commentary on the book I would add to points: 1) A positive- Crichton gave an interesting view of the more bizarre points  modern quantum physics His explanation of the consequences of the mathematical equations is both simple  titlating Furthermore, he gave his far fetched story some scientific backbone doing this Like &lt;Jurassic Park&gt;'s use of the DNA  DNAr  the amber-stuck mesquito's, Crichton gives some believeability to his story with the careful use of science 2)A negative- The actual flow of the story struck me as what you might experience  a video game Each sub-plot had the requisite 'requirements' before completion of the level, followed by a brief lull,  another, more advanced level Eventually this video-come-novel culminated  the destruction of the 'bad-guy' buy the video character  Nevertheless, the story is an interesting read,  for $6, where else could one get his fill of the freaky world of quantum mechanics?
What's happened to editorial discipline  writer restraint?  Someone should have at least had the professional perspective to realize that some stories need to be heavily repaired before putting print ink to paper  Crichton  his editors obviously felt that this book would sell on name recognition alone  br The problems: 1) stereotypical characters, 2)  unbelievable motivations, 3)  underdeveloped subplots that could have added a lot to the story but were dropped  badly handled, , for me the biggest problem 4) the bad guy received a punishment NOT equal to the crimes committed  He didn't kill anybody  wasn't threatening to take over the world  He was just trying to make money by UNDERUTILIZING a remarkable scientific process  A more suitable judgement would have been for him to lose his company  be shamed  the eyes of his competitorsbr The good:  Some of the scenes had good cinematic impact, but even these were overshadowed by the overall lack of cohesiveness
Really two stories  one: the mad scientist with a plausible time machine,  archeologists fulfilling their dream by actually visiting the past they've been studying The long initial discussion of &quot;Quantum Teleportation&quot; is a good fictionalization of new theories  is respectable  timely, too, for an article with the same title appeared  the April 2000 Scientific American magazinebr Most of the rest of the novel takes place  the well-described Middle Ages (already visited  Crichton's Eaters of the Dead)  this unfamiliar setting the action heats up,  turns gritty  abruptly brutal The archeological findings  procedures are realistic enough Here the characters become not particularly lovable under the ferocious stress of their &quot;new&quot; world The emphasis is on derring-do along with some ratiocination, but logic is subordinated to the demands of a good story
Crichton's science fiction generally has the plot: (1)Somebody does something daring with dangerous high tech (2)Something goes terribly wrong (3) Protagonists, who are usually not responsible for the mess, find themselves running like hell This pattern holds here I thought  dragged a bit  the middle, but reved up again by the end Overall, well worth the price  paperback Crichton did good research on the historical period   shows One feature that was interesting was his attention to the practical problems his female characters faced  an era where,  you were a woman  very, very lucky, you were a well-treated item of personal property But this book is really about the remarkable people who labor to reclaim the human past I once considered becoming an archaeologist  was appalled to learn that I might spend years on a graduate degree, master several languages (most of them dead), do dirty, disgusting, student slave labor on various digs,  then find myself perpetually unemployed I chickened out I admire greatly the people with enough passion to know the odds  push ahead anyway Such people would have the courage to cope with the situations Crichton throws at his characters
Is Crichton running out of ideas to have to write on time-travel? That 800 number has been disconnected? (old joke, he once replied that \\"he called a 800 number\\" to \\"how he got his ideas\\") Not really Rather, he disappointingly sidesteps the \\"what  I killed my grandfather?\\" paradox the Austin Powers way, don't worry about, relax  have fun  However, with an entertaining attempt to completely revamp our common idea of the dark ages, he makes \\"history of science\\" look fun Also, with extensive pop quantum physics included, 's quite entertaining science fiction when probabilistic events  causes occur  the story The story-line is Robin Hood-ish, with castles  knights  the lot But, when you put history graduate students  there, the story-line is more than your average run-of-the-mill I know this is just whining, but why would you market time teleportation  history entertainment when you've invented quantum-computers  space teleportation along the way?
For fellow faire geeks, this is one for you When you miss the enchantment of long ago, this book will take you back Michael Crichton's language is vivid  draws you  Potential movie? Maybe  I can't wait for the game Is there a more wonderful way to fall asleep than with visions of France  knights  damsels floating before your eyes
I found the story concept very interesting BUT I can not say this is the best Crichton has done His character development was somewhat weak Nevertheless I think  will make a great movie
Although an enjoyable read, this is not Crichton's best by far  Usually when one reads a Crichton book, you expect a compelling mystery laden with technology  You do not get that  this book  This book feels more like  was made to be a movie  The techonolgy of time travel never really enters the story  Yes  is there, but he never gets into the nitty-gritty as he does  Andromeda Strain, Jurrasic Park, AirFrame,  Congo  That was missed by me  The other issue that I had with the book is that a lot of the characters seem to be ripped right out of Jurrasic Park  Overall, this book did not feel wholly original, as do most of Crichton's book   you want to read a book about time travel to the 14th century, read Doomsday Book by Connie Willis
This is the best sci-fi that I have ever read!  you like medieval history, you will love this book The story moves a little slowly at first, but engages the reader's curiosity enough to keep him  her reading When Mr Crichton leads the reader to an archeological site,  gets into the detail of the students working there  the history of the region, the book becomes totally captivating  Again the story drags for a chapter  two when the students go to the ITC lab  New Mexico, but when they finally travel back  time,  is nearly impossible to put the book down Each chapter ends with the reader wanting to find out what happens next Crichton description of the settings makes the reader feel as  heshe were there The only thing I didn't like about the story was that all the main characters barely escaped death about five times I agree that this book would make a great movie, but  also makes a heck of a novel
After a big excitement at the beginning of the book (time traveling idea always does this to me), I finished this book rather disappointed This book has one of better ideas that Mr Crichton has come up to, with the one of the sloppiest realizations I had that feeling that he had a movie, ( probably big bucks) on his mind, writing this book As I approached the end of the book I got sick of many forced turns, naive descriptions of knight's battles, the way Mr Crichton turned his students-archeologists into the brave superheroes, the shallow way he has resolved the speaking archaic English problem,  so many unforgivable clumsiness's for a serious SF book He did not explain why they were so rushing to get the time machines ready (couldn't they go back  time wherever  whenever they want, after the got them working?) This is going to be a great script for a movie that will take away breath of its 15 year old audience We got used to better Michael Chricton
This book has Crichton's trademark action  But the premise makes no sense,    did, the real issues raised are not pursued at all  the book  His notions of time travel use a lot of quantum bable, but have no credibility  science   they did, nobody would want to participate  time travel as he imagines 
I consider this to be among the best of Crichton's works,  I have read them all, even the John LangeMichael Douglas pseudonym booksbr I have seen this book criticized for 's lack of \\"depth,\\" which I assume means that he didn't do enough with the idea Specifically, the novel is about a computer tycoon who invents a technology that allows people to travel  time - well, not actually  \\"time\\" but close enough His intention is to create a \\"theme park\\" whereby customers can travel to their favorite spots  timebr Now, here comes the most widespread criticism Couldn't you think of anything better than a theme park, Michael? Wouldn't this technology be worth more than that?br Well of course  would But  you have read Crichton's other works, you know that he has what I would call a fairly cynical view of contemporary American culture His point  this novel is that *despite* such an important technology, 's likely that the inventor of this gadget *would* use  for something as asinine as a theme park That is basically the state of contemporary science - important discoveries are immediately being translated into big-money schemesbr At any rate, Crichton leads us through a well-crafted  exciting thriller involving that cutting-edge-impossible-science-made-plausible writing he's so well known for He has also done his homework on medieval France, where the bulk of the story takes place This is by far one of my most entertaining reads  some timebr Lastly, I'd like to mention a supposed \\"hole\\"  the plot that many critics have pointed out This book deals with a \\"multi-verse\\" theory, whereby there is no actual travel  time, but that the characters travel to one of an infinite number of parallel universes, specifically one that exists  the exact time period that the character wants to visit So they don't travel back  time within our own universe, but travel laterally  time to a *different* universe, one that happens to be identical to our own, but still only  the14th centurybr To the point There is a scene where a note left by someone  the parallel multi-verse (14th century France) shows up  our own universe, present-day The criticism? That a note written  a 14th century parallel universe wouldn't show up  our own present-day universe However, those critics fail to grasp the concept Crichton is working with Given an infinite number of parallel universes,  is completely plausible that the exact same scenario (of traveling to a parallel universe) would play out countless times  countless universes The idea is that a traveler from a parallel universe (ie, other than ours) would have traveled to our *own* 14th century France  left the note which we would find  the present day  you haven't read the book yet I'm sure this makes no sense But  will come together after you have read br  I highly, highly recommend picking  up  reading 
This book enters into the same category of The Andromeda Strain  Jurassic park, as far as originality  a perfect balance of real life facts  imagination  introduces many interesting ideas, having to do with what is known about midaeval times,  possible assumptions that could be made  also includes thought-provoking ideas about the future of technology,  what could be possible A very entertaining read from beginning to end, i recomend this book to any fans of the aforementioned books, as well as anyone who enjoys books about midaeval times
This is obviously a book for anyone interested  popculture  not interested  intuitive literature  A typical effort with good possibilities, but so simplistic that  can be easily seen that  was written to be made into a movie where  will make the big bucks   you still want to check for yourself, put he book down after the charachters have made their journey into history
Anyone who adores Crichton as I do (having read all of his novels) will enjoy this novel as well  He continues his ability to apply an incredibly detailed knowledge of his subject matter, to a plot line quick enough to keep even the most impatient reader turning pages  Try not to read the reviews  think too hard about the story line ahead of time,  allow Crichton to expertly guide you through one of his best novels to date
Indeed! Take a bit of science conjecture (guess at best)  throw a little middle-age barbarism into the mix, then strand a bunch of contemporary grad students into a situation where they have absolutely NO business; its a Michael Crichton novel! I did like this book based on my old &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; credo,  I liked the technical front to the story of &quot;quantum foam&quot; ( a scientific hypothesis ) There is a lot of action  suspense  this work , worthy of Michael Crichton,  his view of the deadly up-front day to day struggles for survival of the peasants stand as testament to the progress we as a race have made  these hundreds of years - despite what we may be fed daily  the media A good read Take some time with   absorb the sub-plots I like a good ending,  this has a goodly fair to fairly good one
While the concept is interesting at the beginning of the book,  offers potential, the book unfortunately degenerates into a bad movie screenplay Michael,  you want to write a screenplay do so, but don't try to publish  as an interesting read The stuntmen are already warming up for the first take
I'm a time travel nut so when this book came out I HAD TO HAVE !  I'm so glad I did  The story line is great  the characters (all archeologists) are believable  's got suspense, romance, adventureeverything!  Michael Chrichton has a great story hereread !
Timeline is the best book I have read to date  I was given this book as a gift,  never got around to reading   About 6 months later, I'm bored one day  pick  up  After that, I couldn't put  down!  The plot was great, full of action, some mystery,  even a comic line here  there  Timeline is the only Crichton novel I have read, but I plan on reading many more of his works  This was a GREAT book,  I recommend  to anyone who likes time-travel  historic-fiction
Michael Crichton is a master of science fiction  He has the uncanny ability to take popular scientific subjects such as dinosaurs, time travel,  disease control  create an incredible action packed story with great twists  never ending suspense WOW!
This book was an absolute thriller from begining to end because of Michael Crichton paints the pictures  your head  's a great book  I couldn't put  down   you like medieval history, modern day theories, science  so onthis book is for you  Well, even  you aren't interested  that, 's still for you!
Timeline kept me turning pages, enthralled with what was coming next  After Airframe, which read more like an instruction manual on building planes than a story, I purchased Timeline with great trepidation  What I found was the elements of Jurassic Park  Sphere, two of his finest pieces of work Though I felt a bit overloaded with too much information, which is  true Crichton fashion, I closed the book recommending  to anyone that has read his previous work--naturally adding the qualifier that  is nothing like Airframe (sorry Michael, but  bored me to tears) This is definitely a worth-while read
A nice quick read for anyone who has a combined interest  science, history,  an energetic thriller
Crichton's spin on this often repeated theme (going back  time) was a super read; a roller-coaster  a book! OK, the &quot;villian&quot; seemed familiar, as well as the token female researcher,  but I found the idea of going back to a very scary (to the modern reader) time, to rescue someone, plausible Mr Crichton really knows how to tell a story so that even the most unlikely scenario seems possible The semi-science mixed with historical fiction worked for me I loved the book!
I read this book while on vacation this past summer,   was a perfect beach book  mixes a variety of interesting angles, with a pleasing resultbr The book takes us back  time to medieval France, to the days of knights  shining armor  ladies  distress Crighton throws  high-tech time travel, suspense, mystery,  a critical time limit ( you don't get back to your time machine within the deadline, you're stuck there forever)br I liked the historical novel parts of the book, giving insight as to how real life must have been for women  the past (not everyone was a sighing lady, waiting for her knight to woo her),  the techno geek additions blended well with the story The plot did get a little complicated  cutesy at times, but hey, this is fiction, right?br All  all worth the read, especially  you're a fan of historical fiction mixed with light SF
Reading Disclosure  Rising Sun made me worry that we'd never see another good Crichton book, but this reassured me  I liked the mix of science  historical fiction  this book  I read this book  two sittings, but only because I needed to sleep
As with all of Crichton's books he does a wonderful job at putting you  the setting His books are Science Fiction, but they always have some history  culture to tell you about This one is know different I found the history behind the book very interesting Even  the story wasn't one of his best  still was a fun read
A fabulous ride!!! I read 1  2 books a month  this is the best one I've read this year
The novel Timeline brings out the best of the author Michael Crichton  He uses all of his many tools of writing when he created this piece of work   this novel, Crichton deals with many things that happen  everyday life such as the moral  often important decisions of everyday life   this, the talk is of course about the owner of the company ITC  This owner does whatever will   help him succeed  business  order to get his way  This novel consists of the above mentioned businessman who has created a special device which allows a person to not travel  time but actually go to a different universe of that time  To understand this, you must have at least some concept of Quantum Physics   preparing to produce this novel, Michael studies this science  order to give the best information on the subject  Crichton uses his narrative skills to perfection  the way the story is told  The only flaw that I can see  this book is the length Mr Crichton goes to at the explanation of Quantum Physics  This description could possibly bore  even divert the reader from the book  However,  the novel is read  its entirety  will be well appreciated of Michael's masterpiece  This novel is filled with unexpected twists  suprises that the reader would have never thought of  To experience these you'll just have to read this work of art on your own
Michael Crichton is well known for his exciting novels which are explained by a futuristic science that Crichton leads his readers to believe is possible  He continues to use this writing style  his newest best seller, Timeline   this novel, a small company called ITC, studies  conducts experiments  quantum physics  Somehow, after years of these studies, the company figures out how to \\"send people back  time\\"   the novel, the president of ITC explains how their machines work  Crichton, through this character, tells his readers that there are an infinite number of parallel universes  ITC, with the help of quantum physics, has created a wormhole that will transport people to these different universes  A professor, who is digging up castles  the Dordogne  the south of France, becomes curious  learns what ITC is doing  He contacts ITC , after he begs them, they agree to send him to the year 1357  Unfortunately, he becomes lost  time,  his students Marek, Chris  Kate are sent back to save him  All three students are historians, but Marek is the only one who really loves the medieval time period  He spends his extra time praticing sword fighting, jousting,  learning how to speak the different languages of Europe from this time period  Marek's skills end up helping the group escape several close calls for, while on this mission, they make plenty of enemies   Timeline, Michael Crichton does a great job with characterization  Every character is well rounded  unique  each adds a great deal to the story  Crichton also does an excellent job of incorporating historical facts  scientific evidence into this adventure story  Not only does this book keep readers on the edge of their seat  make them try to anticipate what will happen next, but  also teaches them some interesting historical facts  Though almost the entire book kept me guessing as to what was going to happen next, the ending of the book was fairly obvious to me  However, some readers may be surprised by what happens  I thought Timeline was an excellent novel, filled with lots of adventure   will definitely keep readers trapped within its pages until they finish!
After the less-than-stellar 'Airframe' I was more than happy when I got into 'Timeline'  realized that Chrichton had done  again!  's one of those books you can't put down,  even though 'time travel' is far from the most original concept  the Universe, making  original takes some impressive creativity,   this area Chrichton does a first-rate job   seems that all ( most) of time travel takes place  the future, but not here,  fact going back just a hundred years isn't far ENOUGH Francea long time ago  a world far, far away (sorry, I couldn't help myself)  I DO mean far away  Most people have a pre-conceived notion of what life was like from watching movies  TV which came as close to showing what life was really like hundreds of years ago as you can learn brain surgery from a home-corrospondance course: NOTHING  Now I don't for a second believe that all the research Mr Chrichton did notwithstanding, that this is perfectly accurate eitherhowever I don't read Chrichton's books because he can convince me that what he is writing about CAN actually HAPPEN, I buy them so I can enjoy several hours of entertainment  I am happy to say that 'Timeline' provided me NOTHING but PURE fun  Kudos to Michael Chrichton once again,  for those who unfortunately chose 'Airframe' as their first book to read by Chrichton, I encourage you to give this a shot  Once again I can hardly wait for his next novel,  I would personally be thrilled  another Jurassic book was  the works, however I read an interview with Mr Chrichton who said 'The Lost World' was his last Dinosaur book (but remember, never say never)  I don't care what his next book is, just get  PUBLISHED SOON!
From the first page to the last you are  for quite a ride!  is a top notch science fictiontime travel adventureMichael Crichton has created terrific characters,a wonderful setting  he presents his plot  a most plausible way is obvious that he did a lot of research into different time travel theories  into life  14th century France This added a richness to the storyThe only quarrel I might have is the fading of two chacacters before completing their contribution the storyline   really is a terrific page turnerBe prepared to read awhile!
This is a great movie script The characters are shallow,  easily identified by 1  2 blatant character traits The events are over-the-top  dramatic Each &quot;chapter&quot; (scene?) ends  a cliffhanger , of course, there are plenty of special effects shots Good stuff!br  No one will have any trouble with the premise, which is so unbelievable  filled with enough pseudo-science that audiences will just shrug, patiently wait for the conflict to be set up,  then eagerly watch the actionadventure extravaganzabr  (vague spoiler alert)br  This script gets 3 stars because the actionadventure extravaganza is, well, extravagant  entertaining There's love, betrayal, sword fights, gun fights, dastardly villains, a spooky ghost, heartless politics,  of course lots of explosions br  All the action is propelled by stock characters that are proven to attract US moviegoing audiences: there's the kindly-yet-misguided old professor (all Crichton scripts have this character), the brash rogue with a heart of gold, the noble hero, the spunky female love interest, the previously mentioned &quot;black bart&quot; character,  the amoral capitalist who gets his comeuppance  the end (all Crichton scripts also have this character) br  Good pulp fiction Sure to sell! Three $tar$br  Would have gotten 4 stars, but  was released with a hard cover  non-standard formatting, which I'm sure made  difficult for the actorsbr br  (I'm not kidding: Timeline the movie has been  production for months 's due out May 2001 This really is a script An entertaining script, but a script nonetheless)
I'm a crichton fan Bought this book after all the hype I read  the magazines  bcos I love crichton's writings However,  was a big letdown  was plain simple boring Was very hard to read  finish this book
Are you able to suspend disbelief?  This book's fanciful  compelling (albeit scientifically impossible) story takes readers on a thoroughly enjoyable journey  Crichton, much like Anne Rice, spends A LOT of time researching the historical facts that paint his fiction shows  's well worth   Fun  No, Very Fun
Michael Crichton may not be Hemmingway, but he does tell a good tale  he does his homework   &quot;Timeline&quot;, he tells of a creature of the late 20th century, a scientistbusinessman who discovers something rather like, but not quite the same as time travel  Several experts on the medieval past get caught up  a roller coaster ride to 13th century France during the battles between the French who conquered England  became english  the French who stayed home  The river, the castles, the towns, the monestary  even a fortified mill at issue actually existed  their ruins still exist  the Dordogn valley  Indeed, there is a picture book of this valley currently  print that has amazing photos of these precise castles  that precise strech of river on the cover  There,  full color, are the principal locations of that part of &quot;Timeline&quot; located  the 13th century as they appear today  as Michael Crichton must have seen them!  br Good book!   will make a hell of a movie  hollywood doesn't screw  upbr Darryl Turner PhD
 seems to me that Michael Crichton writes two different kinds of books  On one hand, you have books like Rising Sun, Disclosure,  Airframe  On the other, you have the Jurassic books, Sphere,  Congo  I think he does a great job on both kinds, but I always have more fun reading the more adventure orientated ones  that's where Timeline fits   Expect the usual Crichton scientific explanations here, the cliche characters (Marek was the best of the lot),  all the funbr I didn't enjoy  as much as Jurassic Park of Sphere, but that sure enough doesn't make  bad  MC writes a classic adventure story of a group of college type archeologists lost  France  the fuedal past looking for their professor then a way home  On the way we have sword fights, jousts, damsels that aren't exactly as they seem  my personal favorite, an insane hermit like Knight, looking to cut off one of our heroine's headbr  you love a good adventurous romp  nothing more, then you should find something you enjoy here
Despite the other negative reviews, I thought Timeline was definately an entertaining read, but had its' flaws:BR 1  yes, cliche ridden at times,  but didn't detract from the larger plot &amp; storyBR 2  charecter  decisions seemed a little unrealistic at times -- I think Chriton did  fumble here &amp;  there -- but taken with a grain of salt, I was able to  read-onBR 3  climatic moments, especially near the end seemed a little  overdone  I felt that Chriton was originally trying to sell this as an  action-packed &quot;blockbuster&quot; script instead of a novel  so the  book could have used some more editorial work before release   was easy  to envision the BIG Hollywood explosions here  the BIG Hollywood battle  scene there, etc, instead of catering to just the mere readerbr br But  again, the plot was interesting --  the Sci-fi vein  br Timeline had the  flavor of that fun-to-read story
 he had not written 'Jurassic Park', 'Timeline' would  have been his  best book unfortunately,  isn'tbr would  be my fault  i expected a  'techno-thriller' like  JP? 'Timeline' seems more like a historical novel  br  i had known that this book has more pages about medieval ages, i  wouldn't pick  up easily i'm a fan of Mike cause of JP  'Travels', so  this book isn't my taste
I really liked this book  contains quite an ordinary concept (going  back  time, yeah yeah, no news here) but  is worked out into detail  The author has really researched medieval France  gives a lot of  information to make the trips more believable The story line takes you  along, creates suspense  makes you want to finish this real fast -   not because you hate ! Also, the end is quite impressive Sure,  takes  some 'belief'  the not-so-likely, but  you do (even  you just accept  that time travel is possible) this gives you a good story, well thought  out, which brings you modern sci-fi stuff  medieval down-to-earth  practicalities all mixed into one swinging story!
The opening chapters held much promise, but soon the story shifts  direction  turns out to be another typical time traveladventure  storybr What  you were  your car with your wife, driving down a  desolate desert road, where you come upon a man who seems somewhat  delirious  appeared out of nowhere?  You speak to him, but he babbles on  incoherently  rhymes about things from the past, but you are more puzzled  on how he got out here to begin with  You take him to the hospital where  he soon dies  a spastic fit  Enter the local police trying to figure out  what happenedbr This is how Timeline opens, with a strong X-Files  mystery case  However, this is where the mystery stops,  the story  shifts both locals  characters  We now learn that billionaire Doniger  owns ITC Corp, a company who secretly developed a 'sorta' time machine  based on quantum theorems that Einstein  Stephan Hawkings would be proud  of  However, you don't go back  time  the traditional sense, but  emerge into a parallel universe at a different time  equivalent to our  history  Mr Crichton's strengths lies  the description of this science  which is easy for the reader to understand  makes  very plausible  His research into medieval France is also very exceptional  A few diagrams  are scattered throughout the book that also help the readerbr Anyway, the  three main characters are introduced to us  by all accounts are very  typical  genric for these type of stories  They are archeologists  working on a castle site  France that ITC just happens to be funding,   as the story soon unfolds, ITC *lost* someone back  time  ITC, with  Doniger (a very shadowy figure who only has his own interests  agenda   mind) sends the three back to medieval France with a few companions  Of  course they emerge  the middle of a war  all hell breaks loose where  they are on the run for the next 48 hours  Their mission: find the missing  professor, bring him back without changing history,  without getting  hurt  Of course this isn't going to happen  Nonetheless, the story is  very entertaining  very educational  There is a lot of action  reminiscent of Indiana Jones, but much of the story was way to predictable  You could see the ending a mile awaybr What really bothered me was not  only the obvious predicaments  resolutions, but there were some dangling  plotlines  from the beginning that were never resolved  Examples: What  ever happened to cop who was investigating the death of the strange man  from the desert?  What ever happened to the doctor that performed the  autopsy?  What ever happened to Doniger's PR woman  right hand man?  Why  did no-one ever question  put their foot down to Doniger?br Lastly,  Doniger created this whole technology so he could build very accurate theme  parks, yet he had made other creations (see universal language translator)  which probably made him even richer  less dangerous, but he chooses to  do nothing with br  was a fun story with some good technical   historical lessons  , but otherwise somewhat shallow  depth   surprisesprofessor, bring him back without changing history,  without getting  hurt  Of course this isn't going to happen  Nonetheless, the story is  very entertaining  very educational  There is a lot of action  reminiscent of Indiana Jones, but much of the story was way to predictable   You could see the ending a mile awaybr What really bothered me was not  only the obvious predicaments  resolutions, but there were some dangling  plotlines  from the beginning that were never resolved  Examples: What  ever happened to cop who was investigating the death of the strange man  from the desert?

You really have to have an appreciation for new scientific ideas for this  book to have a lot of meaning The idea that time is not a place to go to,  but rather a parallel existence will be difficult for many to grasp Lots  of people are jumping on the bandwagon saying that the villian was trying  to create a theme park This is not the case His purpose was to restore  castles exactly as they appeared  the past Yes, his intentions were to  make a profit, but not a theme park Timeline has more non-stop adventure  than any of the books that the author has previously written He does an  excellent job of mixing the past with the present This book has gotten a  bad wrap by the other people that have reviewed the book
I have a few major criticisms of this book:br 1) The characters are hollow   uninteresting  you have ever read a book where the characters just  jump out at you because they are so &quot;alive&quot;, then this book will  disappoint (there are any number of books out there with better  characterization; try Curious George)br 2) 3 people get sent back into the  past 2 of them are wet behind the ears students who know nothing about  survival  fighting Yet through the course of this book, they slaughter   make short work of at least 50 armored guards  got to the point  where I didn't ever fear for their lives &quot;4000 guards run  charge  at Chris, Kate,  Marekbut they are no match Chris dives into a  super, whirling battle attack worth 400 hit points of damage per hit; Kate  leaps into the air  releases a volley of incendiary arrows while deftly  dodging arrows left  right; Marek grows to 10 times his size  crushes  soldiers beneath his massive feet&quot;br But the book wasn't all bad -- I  was able to finish  Mike Crichton, as usual, has done his research   the book has accurate details about the time period But sometimes his  writing takes on a condescending tone as he dashingly writes something  like, &quot;Everyone thinks that knights of this time were savage beasts  but that's JUST NOT TRUE You are wrong you laymen Such  such, such   such&quot;  I just want to say, &quot;You're not impressing me Tell  me something new&quot;br Well my advice: go to the local bookstore, close  your eyes, spin around,  point randomly at  any direction Chances are  you'll be pointing at a book that will satisfy you more than Timeline
I bought this book  the expectation that  would be of the quality I am  used to  Michael Crichton How disappointed I was This book starts off  so promisingly  then falls off a very steep cliffbr  would appear  that Crichton wants to see this book become a film I have no doubt that a  film would be alright The book lacks a decent plot The actual basis of  the book is sound, although some might say an overused story I got no feel  for any of the characters  the environment I got very bored of reading  this There were a number of times when I wanted to put the book down   forget about br Save yourself some money  buy something else
I thought that this book was a awesome book Every time that I read  I  read  for an hour  more This book sucks you  as you read , great  concepts,  most of all a GREAT story! Once again, I recomend this  book for anyone!
*** timeline is a very good book, the best crichton had written since jurassic park you won't be able to put the book down till the last  page!***
Because none of us can jump through time I'll keep  very brief This  book was a total waste of time
This book starts out as an exciting adventure leaveing small clues   hints for you to predict what really will happen only bad thing that is   this book is that for about 30 pages the story gets long  slow
First of all I thought this book was very good  for all of you out  there ripping  apart let me set out my reasonsbr 1This is not a quantum  physics textbook so whether its acurate  doesn't really matter - no one  is going to be using this as an instruction manualbr 2  is a piece of  fiction Reading should be used as an escape form reality  holding to  that premise this book is excellent -  is very readable, the story moves  along at a decent pace  its unusual to read a story set on both modern   medieval agesbr  you are not a lover of Micheal Crichton I would  recommend this book because  is not like his others   you I lover of  his books don't get too hung up about character analyses because you'll  lose the point of the book - WHICH IS PURLEY ENTERTAINMENT
Honestly, Crichton must think that the great mass of people are incredibly naive  Hmmm lets see  I don't want to come up with an REAL orginal  plot, so I'll just write another book about a mad genius making a theme  park  I already wrote 2, but no one will notice a 3rd I  guessbr Jurassic Park was an interesting conecpt, The Lost World was  terrible,  Timeline is yet another where the author is obviously more  interested  movie deals than a well-written, well-rounded book with an  ACTUAL ORIGINAL PLOT!br Please Mr Crichton, retire this tired,  &quot;I-must-corner-the-world-vacation-market&quot; storyline  What's  next, &quot;I will create a historically accurate amusement park, with  dinosaurs, on the moon?&quot;  You could call  &quot;The Historically  Accurate, Jurassic Moon Park&quot;  The follow up (for movie purposes only  of course) could be &quot;The Lost Moon Park&quot; Puh-leeeaaasse
Here we go with Mr Crichton Lording  over us how intelligent he is   This novel is good , but this is a case of less is more  I really enjoy  the medieval period  the storyline involving a professor  several   graduate students going back  time to the 14th century was done very  well  The problem comes with getting bogged down  the tiresome  banalities of quantum physics  Once you get past that  is a good read
Until now, I was quite pleased with literary work done by Michael  Crichton I haven't read all of his books, but the few I know (&quot;The  Andromeda Strain&quot;, &quot;Disclosure&quot;  &quot;Sphere&quot;) were  either excellent  very good Now let me tell you my thoughts concerning  the quality of his latest work, &quot;Timeline&quot;br The plot is  strongly divided  two parts, although Crichton obviously intended to tell  the story  four parts The stage of the first part is the present  (nothing unusual, is ?) An old confused physisist is found walking  around  the desert of Arizona, a map of a medieval monastery  his  pocket The man dies, but his unusual injuries let arise suspicions among  the doctors  the hospital where he was treated Then the reader is  catapulted to Black Rock, New Mexico, where the dead physisist worked for a  high-tech company called ITC We find out more about this strange company   its boss, Robert Doniger He is an eccentric genius who founded ITC to  explore a complete new kind of technology based on the laws of the quantum  theory The third location where the story takes place is the shore of a  river  France There a group of archeologists is trying to uncover the  ruins of medieval castles,  ITC obviously sponsors the historians!br The  scientists realize quite quickly the contradiction that seems to exist  between the past  the modern technology As a result, Professor  Johnston, the head of the expedition, visits the company  the USA to find  out what secrets the mysterious Doniger hides Two days later, three  younger historians follow their teacher to America because the latter seems  to be  great trouble They find out that ITC has invented a method to  send people to other universes that present different times of our own  universe,  Johnston seems to be trapped  one of those realitiesbr So  the historians travel back  time to rescue their professor That's the  end of part onebr Part two is an adventurous story about historians from  the 20th century who desperately try to find their teacher among knights,  squires, pages  monks  to bring him back home I don't want to tell  what developments our heroes live trough exactly, but I assure you they are  fascinating for somebody who doesn't want too much philosophy but a healthy  portion of action  suspensebr Part one is written for people who aren't  satisfied only with shooting  killing but who want to know more of how  our world is constructed Crichton presents us interesting facts concerning  high-tech companies, modern technology  science Furthermore we are  shown the ways of how people from the 20th century appreciate history   don't appreciate , for that partbr I would like to comment on the  characters around whom the plot is centered First of all, there is  Doniger Crichton provides us with a detailed description of his life so  that the reader can always say who the boss of ITC is Then there are  Professor Johnston whose personality wasn't really defined, Andre Marek,  one of Johnston's former students, a so-called &quot;experimental&quot;  historian, Chris, the physically weak lover , last but not least, Kate,  the &quot;spiderwoman&quot; whose personality is somewhere out there but   the book because Crichton forgot to characterize her apart from giving her  a name  a country of origin A real pity! I expected more of her!br As I  indicated before, the second part consists of hard action only To be  clear, I have nothing against  What I hate, though, are books  which  the author creates too many difficulties  problems for his characters so  that the books loses its realictic touch  plausibility Using this  criteria alone, I'd have to admit I hated this book Fortunately for  &quot;Timeline&quot;, there are other criteria as well Apart from those  unnecessary turning points, there is a number of big logical mistakes (I  don't want to list them down, but I assure you that they are on the pages  of the novel) Another point I disliked were the descriptions of medieval  time  its people Crichton tried to give them their own language but  couldn't really accomplish  As a result, Lord Oliver  Co sounded  like normal people from our own century  not like &quot;medievals&quot;  They even behaved the way we are used to from our streets Since this book  belongs to entertainment literature, I didn't expect to find more valuable  information about the 14th century Unfortunately there were no major  positive surprises  this pointbr The text above doesn't contain  everything I wanted to express on the subject of &quot;Timeline&quot;, but  I am going to finish this review nevertheless The book as a whole isn't  bad; 's a solid work you expect from an author like Crichton 's quite  enjoyable,  you will remember  for a long time  aren't those two  criteria the most important of all?
But I didn't I couldn't get into the time-travel thing, maybe because   wasn't written well enough for believability  Mr C wanted us to visit  this medievil world of jousts  castles, but the reader just thinks 's  fantasy Sorry Try again
I am a dinosaur fan  I liked this book more than Jurrasic Park  That's  the good news  However, this book follows the same formula as Jurrasic  Park --  starts the same way (some character who only appears  chapter  1 finds a person who dies but gives a clue that something weird is going  on),  has a air of mystery before they get to where the action is,   after that the main characters run around like hell dodging sharp pointy  things  I give this a better rating than Jurassicbr Park because there  were a few clever things  the second half of the book that were kind of  fun,  the ending was neater
Crichton at his usual best  I became interested  Crichton during the  release of Jurassic Park  His attention to detail is great!  Hope to see  more
I basically enjoyed this book  I tend to be a pretty big Michael Crichton  fan,  although I don't disagree with other reviewers who point out some  of the author's shortcomings  this book, well, heck, I was entertained,   that's what I paid for  The problem of whether they are actually   our universe's past  just a very, very, very similar past  an alternate  universe is a real issue, but readers should be aware that  the author's  note at the end of the book, Crichton specifically disavows any pretense to  being scientifically &quot;on the ball&quot;  this book  People are  probably offended that Michael Crichton, of all people, would have truck  with such shoddy science, but the fact is that this is primarily a work of  historical fiction, ultimately intended for the big screen  Although  Crichton is one of our ablest practitioners of the art of science fiction   many respects, the fact remains that he is at heart an entertainer,    this case he just threw together a quasi-scientific rationale that let  him send people to the 14th century  Unlike, say,  &quot;the Andromeda  Strain&quot;, the science here is just a means to an end, not the end    of itselfbr That said, although this is basically not a terribly  complex work, Crichton does try to bring a few historical issues to the  readers attention that many readers might not have contemplated  Lady  Claire is a very strong female figure, using sex  all her wiles to  politic  intrigue her way through the dangerous courts of crazed  warlords, trying to hold onto her inheritance  The architectural stuff  is pretty engrossing -- not a lot of historical fiction deals  such depth  with these matters  There are a few cool little extra elements thrown   -- the game of proto-tennis being played  the monastery; the  sketchy-but-interesting overview of some of the technological precursors to  gunpowder; the general view of knights not as  &quot;knights--shining-armor&quot;, but as incredibly dangerous,  frequently insane, always HEAVILY armed killers, constantly on edge  on  the prowl  an uncertain, deadly, lawless environmentbr I think the  Plague should have been accorded a more prominent role -- although the  action  this book takes place 7 years after the worst years of the  plague, the fact is that  was still a major source of terror, having only  recently killed half of Europe,   kept cropping up repeatedly  throughout the 14th century,  for long after   is hardly even  mentioned  this book, except  passing,   a sort of twist at the  end  Another thing -- the native american doctor  the young cop   the early chapters of the book strike me as being left over from an early  draft of this story, one which was mostly set aside  Mark my words --   (&quot;when&quot;, I should say), this is turned into a screenplay, the  director will somehow incorporate their lines, their roles, into the roles  of the real main characters, Marek, Kate  Chrisbr All  all,  has  its flaws, but 's still entertaining,  realistically speaking,  will  be the only book a lot of people ever read that goes into this much detail  about that period of history
The closest Crichton book I can compare this with is Jurassic ParkLost  World Again with Timeline we have Crichton attempting to astound us 100  pages of astrophysics, quantum physics,  whatnot By no means am I an  expert  these fields, but  this book was actually a piece of science  fiction as I had originally thought  to be, then there shouldn't have  been 100 pages dedicated to persuading us readers that this is actually  possible Nonetheless, the story was decent,  personally I felt that the  excerpt from the history on the Hundred Years' War was used well by  Crichton  sculpting his story  is an exciting ride through fictional  history, but  is also just another one of those &quot;Crichton  books&quot;
This is the greatest book ever written!!!!    is interesting  I  really got into ! I couldn't put  down!!!!!   is definitely the  greatest book I've ever read! My favorite parts were when  was  present  time  they were all worried about the people  the past I really  really liked the end but i can't say what I liked about   I would give  away the whole book All I can say is read  I'm sure you'll like !
 has been a very long time since I really enjoyed a Michael Crichton  novel His last three &quot;Airframe&quot;, &quot;Lost World&quot;   &quot;Disclosure&quot; made me think that Crichton had lost a step  two   the creative process He does come back with &quot;Timeline&quot;, which  is a very well researched  compelling story &quot;Timeline&quot; moves  quickly  is has a lot of action for any reader, but readers of Crichton  will see one glaring aspect that costs the novel  the  endingbr &quot;Timeline&quot; is about a group of historians who get send  back  time to find there mentor Through the use of quantum physics a  &quot;microsoft&quot; type company is trying to exploit the past for  profit This is until things start to go wrong There head historian goes  back to the 1340s  never returns The young historians all agree to go  find him Of course the Hundred Years War is going on,  the story  plunges through the days of knights, seiges  trickery The young  historians find themselves right  the heat of the battle The constant  &quot;will they get back to the present day&quot; is the major antagonist  throughout the bookbr Once again Michael Crichton proves that he is one of  the best at researching for a novel &quot;Timeline&quot; makes great  efforts to truly show what the 1340s were like  addition Crichton  explainations of quantum physics are easily understood  do not take up  the entire book The one thing that bothered me was the fact that the story  runs the sameline as &quot;Sphere&quot;  you have read  &quot;Sphere&quot; you know how  is going to end,   who gets killed  Very rarely was I fooled by an outcome Time to get a new timeline Michael
This was one of the best books I have ever read I read   under four hours  then I read  again  again  again Each time I read  I  noticed something I missed the previous timesbr 's an incredible story  with some of the greatest &quot;interlocking history&quot; elements I have  ever seen What do I mean by that? &quot;Interlocking history&quot; is the  term I like to use for one theory of &quot;you can't change history&quot;:  Whatever you try to do  the past,  results  what actually happened   you go back  time to save a guy from getting hit by a bus,  turns  out you were the one who actually pushed him You try to shoot Oswald  before he shoots Kennedy,  you trip  fall, the gun fires off,  you  were the &quot;second gunman  the grassy knoll&quot;  &quot;History is  never altered, you see  just fits together like a jigsaw puzzle&quot; --  Ford Prefect There is one glaring plothole, though When Chris hears  someone sneeze through his earpiece, why didn't he think of the Professor?  The Professor had an earpiece as established when he told Oliver about  saving Marek's dad's life Why did Chris assume someone else had an  earpiece BEFORE the evidence of the soldiers knowing where they  were?br Other than that, an excellent novel, deserving of a movie  a  sequel
Reading this book is like watching a blockbuster action movie The story  has holes   big enough for a knight  full armor to ride his horse  through, but the action is practically non-stop, swinging along from  beheading to explosion to joust to cliff-hanger br  you go for this kind  of thing, you'll find &quot;Timeline&quot; entertaining, but then you will  wonder why the heck you didn't wait for the movie, which is sure to come -  this novel was very clearly written with an eye on its future marketability  as a movie script,  little elsebr , however, you expect more of a  novel than just that  is a precursor to yet another stale blockbuster,  don't bother to read &quot;Timeline&quot; br As  others of his recent  novels, Crichton makes heavy weather of his supposed familiarity with hip  new science concepts The problem is that he isn't really familiar with the  basic science Lots of obviously only half understood gee-whiz cutting-edge  physics terms are mentioned offhandely  are crucial to shore up the  totally implausible plot The less he understands what this is all about,  the more nonchalantly he uses them Obvious truisms from physics 101 are  listed  boring detail  the hope that this might impress the  science-illiterate reader into believing that he is  fact reading a  credible vision of the world to comebr Something is very wrong with this  novel  clearly is heavily action-based   fact rather un-inventively  rehashes many sure-fire action scenes used ad nauseam  other films   books But for an action novel, why all the science, the sociology,  the  lengthy discussion of topics such as the paradoxes involved  time travel,  why the attempt to debunk commonly held opinions on medieval life?br On the  other hand,  this is supposed to be a book that uses science fiction as a  real glimpse to the various consequences of the technologies involved, why  is all the science plain wrong?  never evenbecomes clear just what the  purpose of the whole exercise of time travel is Concepts of life  the  middle ages are refuted with no proof being offeredbr Crichton should make  up his mind about what he wants to write: trash scifi action  serious  fictionalized science Right now he is trying to ride both horses at the  same time,  failing
The novel starts out interesting enough  A little background on quantum  physics  an archeological dig  Two things that are practically polar  opposites  Usually this makes for a compelling read, but  some how falls  short  br About a third of the way into the novel, Crichton begins  thinking summer blockbuster  writes accordingly  You have the good  looking  intelligent hero, the professor, the attractive firebrand  woman,  the slightly inept but well meaning young man who finds courage   gets the woman at the end  Each character then fits into the Hollywood  script template which finishes  an exciting cresendobr I won't lie   say that I did not enjoy   The hit machine is tried  true   is a  fast summer read that keeps you enthralled  But what really gets me was  that he really could have done so much more with the story  I expected  more
I basically enjoyed this story  Read all the other reviews for the plot   this review I want to point out what I believe are some irritating  things  this bookbr 1  Why is everybody out to kill the time travelers?   From the first moment they set foot  the past,  seems like the sole  purpose of everyone  that time is to kill thembr 2  The CEO was not  really a villian, just amoral  Yet at the end he receives an incredibly  brutal punishment for his actions by the supposedly good guys   his  actions weren't all that badbr 3  The business plan laid out for the  company controlling the quantum time travel is a joke!  They could never  recover the billions invested  re-construction costs of historical sites  from tourism  br 's these kinds of things that keep me from giving 5  stars to this book  Still,  is a good story  I am glad I bought this  book
I'm only 13  I love this stuff! This book is about time travel to  medievel ages I've always wanted to do that Believe   not, but this  book is even better than any Steven King  Harry Potter book This is my  favorite book as you can see I'm not quite done with  though  has a  lot of technical stuff to But what I did is didn't pay a lot of attention  to that part to pay attention to the traveling back  time  all the  stuff happening to the people
Michael Crichton is excellent at what he does -- entertaining readers  By  accepting his illusion of reality through his dramatic style of mixing  scientific research with fantasy, he continues to amaze me with his  storiesbr While I tend to prefer earlier Crichton works (The Great Train  Robbery is my favorite) I do enjoy the current stuff  Nowadays, he seems  to write more as a starting point for the screen play to the next movie   Therefore his books do not seem to spend as much time on doing detailed  character development  plot that wouldn't lend itself to an onscreen  presencebr Don't get me wrong -- the book was entertaining, thought  provoking, etc  I highly recommend for the next  rainy-day-curled-up-on-the-couch afternoon you have
There is no technical  sciece fiction  this book except for the word  &quot;quantum&quot; about five times a page, approriate  not Nothing to  learn about medieval France either What you'll find  this book is what  you see  action movies: chases with last second rescues  not much  more br  you want to read about time travel, get a copy of The Time  Machine by HGWells
A far, far better book is Connie Willis' &quot;Doomsday Book&quot;, from which  seems Mr Crichton took many of his ideas for  &quot;Timeline&quot;  &quot;Doomsday Book&quot; was published before  &quot;Timeline&quot;,   is very interesting how much of the initial  story set-up the two books have  common  Maybe Mr Crichton isn't so  original after all!
This is a great book for you  you like Crichton's style of writing   's another disastersuspensedrama type story- a combination that is  unputdownable  The story is intriguing,  you can tell that Crichton did  a LOT of research, as he is historically accurate throughout most of the  story  The characters are well developed,  as always, the setting is  described  great detail  Michael Crichton chose a great period of time  to &quot;travel&quot; to  this book, as the time period provides a lot of  action  plot twists  Near the end, I liked how the story switch off  between the present,  the past  This kept me reading to find out what  was happening  the other world   closing, this book has a everything  of things going for - great story, characters, setting, etc  I just  can't wait for the movie (Due out Spring 2001)  the PC Game (No release  date as of now)  Buy the book first though, I bet 's better
Timeline is amazing!  is simply a great book This is probably my  favorite book ever (aside from maybe Harry Potter),  is filled with  science fiction  time travel, along with midevil times (which is the  best part of the book) An exciting book the entire way through with plot  twists through-out  a very suprising ending This is Crichton's best  yet! Bravo!
I admit to being a Michael Crichton devotee, even down to locating, purchasing  reading all of the bad thrillers he wrote as &quot;John  Lange&quot;, so there's not much he could do to disappoint me  Just so you  know where I'm coming from br  Crichton offers us here another example of  his &quot;Living Worse Through Bad Science&quot; chronicles, each of which  shows how, through the judicious bending of physical laws  accepted  fact, things can blow up  our collective faces,  at least the faces of  an intrepid band of unfortunate travelers (  intrepid loner with  powerful,  anonymous, friends, as the case may be)  &quot;Timeline&quot;  is an engaging thriller that offers not much of value to the Crichton  oeuvre, but will give you at least one sleepless night as you race with the  time travelers to the conclusion br  I read the book  a single evening,  so my single bone of contention here is that the book was money wasted  I  can spend nine bucks to see a three hour movie,  $23 to read this novel   three hours; I'd rather Crichton beefed up his novels a tad   stretched my entertainment dollar for me br  The plot isn't too demanding;  a group of grad students is sent to a parallel universe, only further back   time, to rescue a missing historian  There are complications, bad guys,   a tight schedule with which to contend,  along the way Crichton  regales us with facts he has gleaned from a library of books, the  bibliography for which he has thoughtfully provided  the back  I am  always grateful to read the distillation of someone else's education;   saves me having to read all those tedious books myself br   you like  Crichton's formula, you'll like this book   &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;  annoyed you, you'll be annoyed here, too br  Happy reading
Crichton writes a wonderfully exciting book that allows the reader to use  hisher imagination  This is a page turner that I thoroughly enjoyed  I  highly recommend !
I could not put &quot;Timeline&quot; down  Crichton makes you think about  the theories of time-space  time travel  turns them into a wonderful  piece of literature  I look forward to   when this becomes a  movie  I just hope the writers are true to the book, not like  &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;  &quot;The Lost World&quot;
I like this a little although has some very choppy lines
What I look forward to  a Crichton novel is his ability to make the  unimaginable seem real,  his ability to create three dimensional  charecters that are ready to step off the page  That didn't happen here   seemed to me that he simply put together a product for the year 2000  The second star is for the research, not for the plot   was predictable,  even as to who would stay behind  Usally I have to force my self to but  down a Crichton novel, with this one I had force my self to finish
pretty dang good  read 
I feel Crichton wrote the best book ever i recommend  to any crichton  fan ! The ending was amazing  i am totally  awe of his writing I've  read all his books  this was the diamond of them all beautiful book !
Having taught Medieval history, I am well aware how infrequently the era  is addressed  popular culture  spite of the cult of Creative  Anachronism who recreate this era, few people seldom get  right   is  obvious that Crichton has done his research well  His tale is fascinating   accurate  has high adventure  great suspense  is not a classic  by any means but  is a highly enjoyable read   is further amazing that  Crichton combines high technology  science with Medieval lore   culture  is a highly appealing mix  he handles them both very well  This is a perfect light read for anyone who wants to take themselves into  another world My only criticism of  is that  seems to be written  towards a screenplay formatso the movie shouldn't be far behind   would have been nice   had more of a literary feel But that is a minor  complaint Mount your steed  charge into this book with abandon You  won't be sorry
Michael knows how to construct a story  make  so beautifully well  creative  sound You will be amazed by his ability
I have read two books by Michael Crichton  attempted four This is book  is probably the best effort so far  is an intriguing storyline but he  has yet to deviate from his typical book writing formula  you've read  any book by him, you've read this one too but this is probably the best  storyline so far
This is,  my opinion, is one of Crichton's best works Sure the first half might be a BIG yawn, but the last half, you'll find  impossible to put the book down My only wonder is what the company decide to do with the  time machine Are they stop to improve the machine  keep  going?  But  anyway, 's a great work  I really admire Crichton for his strong will  to make all those research Great work, not the one to be missed! Trust me!
He's done  again!  Wonderful plot  story line keep you interested  another great Micheal Crichton book  I downloaded this book on my PocketPc  couldn't put  down after I started reading   Beautifully written   as always, he gives great details  explaining all the historic   scientific subjects  Don't take my word for , read  for yourself!
what a pity! a good idea spoiled by a non-sense plot the first 150 pages are interesting but when we move  the past is not clear because our heroes risk their lifes for a Professor that looks more a stupid fool than  a professorbr I read with pleasure (5 stars) the Robbery,Andromeda, Congo   I really regret because of this flopbr  you really like enter  the  middle eve world lets read the NAME OF THE ROSE of Umberto Eco luigi  accomazzo italy
I read this book as an eBook on my PocketPC   was great!  I found the story compelling  evocative  I particularly appreciated the juxtaposition of technologies modern  ancient
I thought that Timeline, Michael Crichton's latest work was a very good read Altough  was very long, that didn't bother me The plot is basically a cross between &quot;A Connecticut Yankee  King Arthur's  Court&quot;  &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, one of my favorite movies  The first 40 pages were very interesting about how he introduces ITC, the  main company  the book The president of ITC, named Robert Doniger,  reminded me of another Rupert Murdoch  Bill Gates br Kate, Andre  (Marek),  Chris are the three main time travelers There were 2 other  time travelers, but one died  another went back The 37 hours spent  there is interesing  fast-moving There are many interesting things to  do for them, though, like jousting tournaments  battling guards They  blend  very good with the crowd, which they need to,  even lie about  some things The race to get back to the quantum transistors is fast   furious, but only two of them make  br That ending is kinda sad, but  after that, some other people have sent Doniger back into time during the  plague I thought that this ending was very funny  I hope you like the  book, because I did,  I thought  was a great book to bring on vacation  because I read  over spring break    really held your attention  until the book was over This book was reccomended by a friend who loves  Crichton  he loved the book
This is a must for anyone who loves adventure,  history  Michael Crichton does an excellent job of describing the midevil time of which this story goes into  I thoroughly enjoyed    has a plot that never lets  down,  has a great finish
When I wised up  began to read for pleasure (School always made  difficult for me to enjoy books I hated to have to read) Not one Michael Crichton book has let me downbr As usual, I would suggest you not find  out about this book just read  Reading a book is more exciting when you  have no idea what's inside I assure you 's a great read for the  technically minded individual who can visual what is read
Michael Crichton is an excellent writer  I admire Crichton for being able to write about so many things  (Gorillas  the jungle, dinosaurs on a island, virus outbreaks, airplane crashes)  Timeline has not only added  to the list of topics, but has brought back that Crichton touch that was so  compelling that was missing  Airframe  The Lost World Timeline is  obviously about time travel,  Crichton does a wonderful job with this  aspect of the book  He gives us a very unique  intriguing look at the  possibility of time travel  Although time travel makes the story   Timeline possible, the real heart of the story is  the Medievil period   The setting he gives us for this period  time is outstanding,  the  detail he puts into  is not only withstandable, (for those of us who have  trouble with detail) but also interesting  Crichton did a marvelous job  So why three stars?  The plot gets to repetitive  Halfway through the  book, the characters begin to run from the enemies (I'm trying not to give  away anything here)   for a long time its just a game of chase, the  charaters miraculously run from,  defeat whoever is chasing them with one  hand tied behind their back,  gets too repetitive, predictable, cheap  movie like,  gets less believable  I think Crichton just needed to add  a little to the plot,  cut the book down so  didn't get like that   I  may have sounded a little too negative there, the plot does keep you going  til the end,  just has weak points,  you may be disappointed with the  predictability of the last third of the novel So, to sum this all up,   you've never read Crichton, this is not the book to start trying to, start  with Jurassic Park  Congo,  another highly rated book of his For  longtime Crichton fans,its worth your time
Take a group of archaeologists who are specialists  Medieval History, transport them back to the Middle Ages at the exact site they are working to unearth,  then sit back  watch them try to survive the skirmishes,  intrigues,  everyday hardships of the life at that time,  you have  the bare bones of Timeline  Add  an accident at the laboratory from  which they were transported,  back to which they hope to return,  the  tension builds as the scientists  the present day attempt to reconstruct  the equipment necessary for a return  The travelers do not all return to  the present time (for a variety of reasons)  the ones that do are  profoundly changed  As usual, Crichton has done his homework, both  the  area of the history involved  the science of time travel  The research  serves to lend credence to the unlikely possibility of time travel, but   doesn't get  the way of a rousingly good story  As a middle school  teacher, I'm excited about integrating the reading of parts of this novel  into our social studies unit on Medieval History; the students will come  away with a more personal understanding of this period  the harshness of  life during the Middle Ages
I was very disappointed by the latest book of Michael Crichton, of whom I am a great fan What I appreciated  his earlier books was the capacity to treat various issues (about society, science, ethics)  a highly  entertaining way But his latest book seams to have been wrote more for the  movie that inevitable will follow rather than to convey some idea The  story is packed with action  centered on a group of American students  sent beck to Medieval Europe But the ploy is weak  highly predictable,  with the group going through fights with Medieval knights as easily as  having a game of Ping Pong,  ultimately the story start to repeat  -self, with the end where &quot;the bad guy&quot; will pay for his  arrogance
i thoroughtly enjoyed TIMELINE as  contained some crichton elements missing  his last couple books - that perfect mix of research, education,  adventure that leave you thrilled  more informed  PLus the 'clock  ticking' angle keeps the book suspenseful
Personally, I have yet to read a BAD Crichton novel  I think this man is an extremely gifted author,  he demonstrates this talent once again  TIMELINE  Perhaps my expectations were a bit too high, though  As a fan  of both science fiction  Arthurian literature, I thought TIMELINE had  the formula to be the best book I'd ever read  While I was heartily  entertained, I think that purists (like myself) will unfortunately find  flaws  this tale  I kept second-guessing Crichton's logic regarding the  whole time travel concept  I found  easier to suspend disbelief  his  earlier works including &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;Sphere&quot;,   &quot;Congo&quot;br I also found that, like many of Crichton's novels,  TIMELINE tends to build very slowly toward its climax  There are more than  a few &quot;yawns&quot;  the first half of the book  However,  is  literally impossible to put the book down during the last 100 pages (again,  typical of Crichton's work)br For first-time readers of Crichton, realize  that the attention to detail is one of his trademarks  He does go into  lengthy explanations regarding the theory  structure of the time travel  mechanism   you have no scientific background,  dislike technical  writing, you may find this frustratingbr Overall, most people will find  this to be a very good book   is not Crichton's BEST work,  my  opinion, but  is very good nonetheless
This book was very well done  The content allowed the reader to expand hisher knowledge on up to the minute science  14th century France   makes you wonder what technological discoveries are being made that no one  knows about   also forces you to question  the past really occurred as  we think  did  The story flowed, as well  br PS To Pike (122899),   you care so much about editing the book, please be advised that the  scientist you were referring to is named Doniger, not Donigen
This book is so good!  I could not let  down for three days  was like I was there !   I got Micheal Crichton to sign  when he was here  Iceland   thet made the book alot better!
i don't care what any body says about Timeline, this book was freakin  awesome one of the best for Chrichton i think even though 's the only  one i have read from him the story line is very cool,  you have to read  over about how they time travel cuz  confused the heck out of me  is  very accurate with the dark ages  they way Chrichton describes every  thing is way cool but mainly there is not a slow part  this whole book   i love how they get even with the boss  the end  you like time  travel, quantum physics, sword fighting, shooting arrows, beheadings,  horses, castles,  knights u will love this book
Michael Crichton has given us readers cause for excitement whenever his latest novel appears - they tend to be well worth the waitbr 'Timeline' then, must be the exception to the rule 's really a movie script  disguised as a novel The pace, the detail, the characters, the plot all  seem to have come straight from a big-budget Hollywood movie rather than  from a book from one of the more gifted  imaginative writers of our  times
I heard about this book from my Architecture History professor  The way  combined architectural elements with the historical  then added modern science to  intrigued me  As an architecture student I was  absolutely fascinated by the book  On top of that,  had a plot that kept  twisting  turning leaving me to wonder what could possibly happen next   I have read a lot of Crichton books,  this was definitely another great  one!
 may be beach reading  may have characters that get lost There may even be missing elements, but that doesn't stop this from being a fun, suspenseful, page-turning read Those that only buy Crichton for futuristic  techno-thrilling will be disappointed, maybe But I was just as fascinated  with 14th [1380s are 14th century, not 12th] century  the characters  &quot;lost&quot; there as with the technology available today [something I  always love about the way he writes] Nice to see the past having an impact  on the present instead of the present having an effect on the future Tho  there's a place for that, too  you don't want to pay hardback prices,  borrow   wait for paperback But 's a good book,  the best of his  I've seen  awhile
Does the world need another over-blown Crichton epic?  Obviously not, but here  is anyway   yes, zillions of people like myself plunk down some hard earned cash  partake of a little harmless mind-candy  Such is  life  This probably wouldn't have been a bad novel had Crichton been able  to pick one time travel theory  stick with   Instead, he seems to  remain confused ( thus, so does the reader) on whether  not his  charcters have actually journeyed back to the Middle Ages  have merely  entered a parallel universe resembling that time period   not content  with writing only bad science this time around, Crichton also gives us bad  history as well, with a depiction of life  the Middle Ages about as  accurate as what you might have seen  an episode of &quot;The  Smurfs&quot;   you're looking for a simple beach-read, by all means pick  this up  You'll likely have a good time  But for more accurate   engrossing version of time travel to the Middle Ages, try &quot;The  Doomsday Book&quot; by Connie Willis
I am somewhat disappointed with this book  The storyline is similar to his previous masterpiece -Jurassic Park, Lost World hence the ending is predictable  However, i have to commend him on his brilliant research on  quantum technology which I find truly enlightening
A brilliant amalgamation of modern technological 'fiction' with historical reality  An outstanding read
crichton's latest is eminently readable  his usual page-turner way  provides a fascinating insight into life  12th century france 's probably thoroughly accurate  that respect too but there's something  about modern day people clowning around  middle age costumes saying  forsooth  hey nonny nonny that makes you embarrassedly look up from the  page every now  then to check nobody  the subway car has seen you  crichton has always dwelled challengingly on the border between what is  possible  what is yet beyond the grasp of science here a considerably  larger than usual measure of disbelief suspension is required for the  enjoyment of this otherwise quite thrilling thriller
This book is came to be just the best that I've read until now this year  Michael Crichton has the power of bringing us inside his world  His detailed descriptions of every scene make us feel that we are inside of    We can barely smell the horses  everything
I was excited to finally see a new book from Michael Crichton hit the shelves last Thanksgiving  I just got to  now,  unfortunatly,  wasn't what I was expecting  Yes there is the usual info,  the  suspense, but something is missing from Timeline   seems to follow the  same formula of all actionsuspensethriller novels  which the good guys  avoid every possible danger that would lead to their death,  the  villians trip the wrong way  meet their demise  From Chris escaping  death of &quot;skilled&quot; knights numerous times, to Kate flying off  beams high atop a castle,  just isn't realistic  Although I must say  that Andre Marek is one of the most interesting charcters I have met  a  Crichton novel  a long time, which is saying a lot since character  description is not his high point  A mixed review; not good, but not bad  either
Timeline was, by far, one of the worst books I have ever had the displeasure to read Crichton put his one dimensional characters into strings of impossible conflicts, one laughably close to the other, which  they extricated themselves from with the luck of heroes from children's  cartoons Consider, trained soldiers can only brush them with their arrows,  yet when the female character Kate picks up a bow after only being trained  a bit by another character, Marek, she kills with ease  general, the  writing style seemes hurried (ex page 320, last paragraph), as  the  author was tripping over himself to complete the book, not wanting to spend  time on any serious description Timeline was, however, worth one star The  Multiverse Theory is a compelling issue that,  terms of quantum  computing, will have profound real-world effects on our future lives   cannot be argued that Crichton tackles interesting ideas, but the way he  goes about  would be best served between the front  back covers of  young adult books
Anyone who has read Connie Willis' excellent &quot;The Doomsday Book&quot; will recognize   Crichton's cartoonish comic book rendition of this Middle Age time travel story  's simply &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;  a  castle  Delete &quot;raptor&quot;  insert &quot;Knight&quot;  Same  story, same characters, same sacrifice of historical accuracy for the sake  of thrills
A read for traveling  the beachwhen  isn't important to follow exactly what is happening  The premise for the novel is good, interesting,  maybe even plausible  However, characters  even subplots were not  developed as fully nor as interestingly as they could have been Read   think, for example, about the opening scenes  the desert  the  hospitalthe &quot;map,&quot; on the old man, the good  eager young  cop, the earnest  hard-working native-American female doctor, their  romantic interest  All pop up somewhat later, but never really take a part   the plot other than to take up printed space Too much written, too  quickly  as others have pointed out, this novel will probably make a  good movie  I rented a library copy rather than waste my money!
I have read nearly all of Michael Crichton's books &amp; like the rest of the world ,found his 'Jurassic Park' &amp; 'The Lost World'incredibly fascinating  that is why I picked up 'Timeline'with the eager  anticipation of a great read  br         But u know what I found? That  unlike the originality &amp; captivating themes of his previous books  ,'Timeline'deals with a theme that has been dealt with by sci-fi authors  over &amp; over &amp; over againthat of a team of scientists travelling  back into the past &amp; going through the same stuff that all people who  suddenly are faced with a 'blast to the past 'do ---fight for survival with  all primitive weapons{ note---successfully!} &amp; just when they are  finally cornered ,VOILA! press the button &amp; transport home is right  there!  The only claim to originality that this book has is that instead of  dealing with directly going into the past of the same universe as usually  happens ,this time they actually travel to an earlier time of an alternate  universe for the rest ,you are left with the same old tales of knights  &amp; castles &amp; a beautiful damsel --- who instead of only seeming to  be  distress also seems to be causing most of the distress --- &amp; a  modern-day threesome who would put Houdini to shame the way no cell room  can hold them  &amp; here &amp; there ,just to remind u to throwup,you  are also fed with gruesome tales of how previous misfortunates met their  end! br             you are a total fan of Michael Crichton's  irrespective of what he writes ,then I will say that inspite of the ancient  theme ,'Timeline'does make a passably good read  but  you are  expecting something exotic &amp; different on the lines of 'Congo ,Jurassic  Park etc',well then you'd better pass  on  would be a total  disappointment!
Crichton does what he does best  his books - leaping over the fence of uncertainty  using  to take us beyond our wildest dreams His use of modern science , combined with the most extreme implications of this  revealing world of physics is truly overwhelming
Michael Crichton writes, I read But this one was a frustrated effort The action is perfect for a film However, the main characters were - at every turn - losing each other  was too much, too often  will make a great  action film, but  text was frustrating to read I kept thinking,  &quot;Good GRIEF, not again!&quot; I finished the book ONLY because I am  compulsive,  not, I would have put  down halfway through
First of all: This book is an action movie  print The characters are  flat  undeveloped,  the turn of events strictly follows the logic of  suspense  surprise &quot;Saved  the last second&quot; is one of the  favorite artistic devices of the author Secondly: I have read the book   one go  takes just a few hours,  the book is almost impossible to put  down That is an achievement  itself One star Thirdly: Crichton is  fascinated by technology for its own sake He is not very interested  the  way  impacts people's feelings, their view of the world, their values,   their social relations However, he brings to life the ideas of quantum  theory  the technology behind medieval warfare One more star Finally:  The book proves one particular point  a clever way As one of the  characters  the book claims, the driving force behind the business of  &quot;time tourism&quot; is the realization that &quot; other centuries,  human beings wanted to be saved,  improved,  freed,  educated But   our century, they want to be entertained  This is the intellectual  reality of Western Society at the end of the century&quot; Of course, I  said, this is not true for me Pure entertainment - not me! But let's face  : I have spent hours reading a book only because of its entertainment  value,  I have been easily tricked into proving Mr Crichton's point I  am impressed Third star
Having read all of the previous Michael Chrichton books  loved every  single one of them, I was especially excited to pick this one up After  Airframe I was a little disappointed that Chrichton had lost that special  touch that makes his books really different from everyone else, but he has  rekindled the spark here  Timelinebr  you enjoy reading Sci-Fi   Fantasy reading, then you will throoughly enjoy this practical look at the  genre Even  you don't, then you will be able to enjoy this book because  Chrichton brings reality to an unreal world  Timeline br A group of  archeologists are exploring an archeological dig  make the discory of a  lifetime Find out what happens when a high-tech firm that owns the site  has other plans for  that the archeologists had no idea about,  what  they are  store for, is the time of their life, literally!
When  comes to books, I always give a second try I give another  &quot;chance&quot; to the authors I didn't like when I read the first time  That's the case of Michael Crichton br          After watching lots of  wonderful movies based on his screeplays  books, I tried to read  &quot;AIRFRAME&quot; What a disaster! Didn't like the book But then time  passed  TIMELINE came So I thought: the subject (time travel) is cool,  the plot seem interesting, then why not try to read ? I bought    started reading  the same night When I glanced at my wristwatch,  was  midnight, I had read more than 120 pages  didn't want to go to sleep!  br          Even being a little complicated sometimes (not the plot itself,  but the explanations he gives for the things that happen, too tecnical) the  book is a wonderful entertainment  make you wish for much more The  characters are well developed, the plot is very well-written  you soon  find out that Michael Crichton isn't probably the best author out there,  but he certainly has something good to offerbr          That's why   makes TIMELINE a great reading Buy , start reading,  be prepared to  be hooked by this wonderful story!br Marco Aurelio
All I can say isWOW!   you are looking for a book which both engages  your mind  draws you into a well written storythis is !  While a  combination of quantum physics time travel  detailed descriptions of  life  Medieval France may initially seem a bit odd, the fact that this  book is incredibly well researched makes the story absolutely fascinating   Truly I have not enjoyed a book this much  a great while  Pack your  brain, curl up  a comfy chair,  get ready to travel!
This is only the second book written by Crichton that I have read    was the best so far  As a recreational medievalist I found the idea of  going back to medieval France great  Crichton did a wonderful job of  explain quantum theory  the related science  I was also happy to see  that he did research the time period he was writing about  did justice  to history as well as science  I would recommend this book to all my  reading friends, medievalist, scientist,  anyone hust looking to read a  great book
Crichton, whom I've always admired as a writer for his attention to  detail, goes far afield  this novel  The postulate of parallel universes  is npt new  the thought of visiting one has interested quantum  physicist  The asynchronous time aspect is a nice twist  The story is OK   Crichton didn't hurt himself doing too much research on France circa 1000,  but the ending is unbelievable  Answer one question  someone dies  an  alternate universe can you visit his grave  your universe?  Obviously,  Crichton is mixing his quantum states which any physicists will tell you  cannot be done safely  He really could have done better  He did a far  more credible job stretching science  Jurasic Park then here   wasn't  worth the effort
This book is entertaining, simple  well structured  Chrichton is a man of few wordswhich helps when you read the book on a pocket pc
 the beginning I thought Mr Crichton was back on track, writing a real novel after some past silliness of the Jurassic variety  The deserted desert opener is appropriately creepy, the history is fascinating, the  physics piques my curiosity,  the tech stuff is plausible  even the  characters are believable  But then disappointment sets , page by  page, as I realize this is just another movie script loosely disguised as a  bestseller  The action scenes, the improbably slow passage of time with  more happening  a half hour than could possibly happen, etc   yet, I  read on to the end, turning pages, curious about the outcome, glad on the  whole that Crichton takes the trouble to entertain us  any format  I'll  recommend , but with a mild warning about the need to suspend one's  disbelief
Timeline is a well-written, highly suspenseful, action-orientedscience thriller The plot is well thought out  tightly woven, andthe scientific premise is fascinating  extremely well-researched The presentation of detail, both scientific  historical is expertly done  The technological innovation of the time travel (alternative universes through quantum foam) is unique  convincingbr What makes  work for me is the grand scale of  all Crichton sets up big stakes The person travelling is vaporized by lasers, then &quot;faxed&quot; through tiny wormholes into another potential universe of which there are an infinite number The author shows us a big underground complex, fabulous cyclotron-scale machinery  a compelling demonstration of the technology  This is big science involving huge risks;  is grand  scope  the details seem right We want to suspend disbelief for time travel because time travel has reached a mythological status  our society Who wouldn't want to travel back  time? 's a secret fantasy for many of usbr Note: this was also true for Jurassic Park We wanted to believe that  was possible to bring dinosaurs back to life, out of extinction Dinosaurs are grand  fantastical; anyone would want to see one Our desire to have  be true is part of why we go along with the leaps of technology  Jurassic Park The same is true  Timelinebr  addition to the science being appropriate, Crichton's historical context feels real The Medieval characters speak  act  a way which while not expected, feels right on the mark I am not an expert  the French Middle Ages, but sense authenticity  this bookbr Also, I couldn't put this book down The chapter breaks were predominately cliff-hangers  the pacing was fast  furious Crichton sets up a &quot;ticking clock&quot; time table  puts  out front where all can see,  where we can worry about  's a tried  true tactic   works very wellherebr  lastly, the thematic elements are strong, convincing  arise neatly out of the story without being dictated to the reader I draw attention to this here because the successful handling of theme is something which cannot be accomplished without adequate handling of plot  character  even so,  is not an easy thing to do well  is done well herebr Nevertheless, with all that said, I believe that Timeline could be improved First of all, there are too many characters While Crichton does a fair job of keeping track of them all, with so many major characters, the reader doesn't have time to become emotionally involved  any of thembr The major protagonists are Marek, Chris,  Kate Professor Johnstone  Stern are minor protagonists The major antagonist is Doniger ( the present), but there are a series of characters  the past who provide the main threat (Sir Guy Malegant, De Kere, Oliver)br The book would benefit from trimming one  two of the protagonists,  pushing one of them into the role of a minor character The most memorable protagonist is Marek He is unique, likeable,  he always acts up to his potential (which is considerable) Marek has all the ingredients of a perfect thriller protagonistbr As a book doctor, I would suggest making Marek the primary protagonist  diminishing the role of Chris  Kate Chris was my least favorite character, mainly because he is so ordinary Therefore, I wouldn't mind seeing his role lessened Kate was nicely drawn  would make a good alternative main protagonist These suggestions, as always, are merely that; the role of a good book doctor is to analyze  suggest, then let the writer do whatever he  she feels is right for the bookbr I believe that focusing on Marek would of necessity expand his character  would put him &quot;on stage&quot; more,  we would get a better insight into him We would get more emotionally involved  his dilemma We could seemore character growth this way,  there would be a defined character arc which is lacking  the book (with the exception of Chris's character) More on character arc belowbr Another problem I had with this book was the intense action all the way through Intense action is great,  here  is handled well However, the pace never lessens There is no sense of rhythm, no time to catch your breath The action scenes lose their power when put between two equally intense scenes because we have grown insensitive by overexposurebr Also, many of the scenes are rushed The setting details are often brushed over so that the pacing isn't slowed I found much of the detail which Crichton did include fascinating;  enriched the story for me Including more setting  certain, carefully-chosen scenes would serve to slow the pacing a bit too This would enhance the experience of the storybr  I had worked on this manuscript, I would have suggested that the author examine the scenes one by one to look at pacing Character development  setting are two things which slow the pace,  this novel could use a bit more of bothbr With that said, however, I have to say that overall, Timeline is an excellent thriller  has an unparalleled premise, innovative  carried-off brilliantly The author has gone to great trouble to insure the verisimilitude of his setting, characters  dialogue The book has all the ingredients of a blockbuster: high stakes, nail-biting suspense  fast-paced action With a few minor adjustments - trimming the number of major characters  the strengthening those who remain, fixing the glaring coincidence which strands the heroes  the past,  tweaking the pacing - this book could be flawless Even so, I look forward to Crichton's next novel with anticipation
I have actually never seen the show, but isn't that a great opening line?  Anyway, this book is written  a similar fashion as the other &quot;outdoor thrillers&quot; as I like to call them, such as Jurassic Park   The Lost World  However, the amazing descriptions of the land that you  are transported to are unlike anything I have ever read  Ignore the person  who says that  has the same plot as the others (a madman making a theme  park) because I didn't find  to be stressed as much as  the JP books   This book is worth buying because of 's a new idea  a great   exciting story from The Man
This is a fine story But looks to me full of bugs I am a MA of the history of science I didn't do  by myself, but a friend of mine studied the history of Chinese siege warfare, including the use of firearms That's why I liked his description of medieval life As to the quantum mechanics,  I have to say 's a disappointmentbr Technically, this book is far from  _Jurassic Park_ The use of quantum technologies is nothing but a spell  Finally, you learned nothing but some buzzwords The gap is too wide, you  just can't buy   _Jurassic Park_, there's more--less valid way to  build a dino out of amber preserved insects  _Timeline_, you have to  suspend your disbelief over  over because most critical technologies  were not explained Nothing is explainedbr Let's say the lossless fractal  compression  's fractal, 's very possibly lossy Otherwise, 's not  going to reach a very high compression ratio, as loseless compression is  subject to a theoretical limit related  its entropy So you don't have to  use fractal Believe me, fractal is just one of the many unexplained tech  terms used  this book
I love time travel!  This is a great book for anyone that enjoys the idea of time travel   falls  with Star Trek, Quantum Leap, Frequency, etcbr Timeline throws  a bunch of cool new technical info that can make   possible to go to the 14th century  br  seemed to take a little while  to build up momentum but once they &quot;leaped&quot; I could not put the  book downbr Great book for a summer vacation  Much more exciting than  Airframe
God knows this book already has enough reviews, but since  has an abundant number of negative reviews ( indeed, the first one visible one the page), I have decided to put my 2 cents  Well, simply put: (  coming from a reader who has been through all of Crichton's non-fiction  books but one) 's one of his best The only ones that i think surpass   are JP  Disclosure   you were one who liked Jurassic Park ( who  didn't?) then this is right up your alley  is a thrill-a-minute ride of  suspense, but without leaving out complex science issues, indeed, there may  be more here than  any of Crichton's other books The issues of quantum  physics  quantum teleportation raised  this book are very interesting   thought-provoking,   actually serves to make time travel seem  possible For these reasons,  many others,  is a must read
This book was entertaining for awhile, the mixture of science  fiction was, as always with Crichton unique However the characters were hardly developed  shallow as was the story I felt like  was written for the  sole purpose of being made into a movie  Overall  was a big  disapointment
One thing I have always admired about Chrichton is his ability to  entertain  educate his readers simultaneouslyTimeline, my opinion,is his best  most interesting work yetI will not deny the book can be a  shockingly violent  some places,but this only adds emphasis to  Chrichton's apparent theory that the Middle Ages were no walk  the  parkAn action-packed,intense page turner
I have found most of Mr Crichton's books to be interesting reads of varying caliber  With &quot;Timeline&quot;, Michael finally wrote one that I couldn't put down  Granted, as with his other recent works, this book is  advanced pulp fiction designed for movie adaptation  Yet unlike those  other such works (&quot;Jurrasic Park&quot;  &quot;The Lost World&quot;)  this novel is a great tale of suspense  action  You may even learn a  few things about the philosophical implications of Quantum Physics   Medaevil European History while you are at  (the research effort Michael  Crichton puts into his books is always top notch)  Make sure you have  plenty of time when you open the cover, you will not be able to set   aside easily  Join Mr Crichton's cast of quirky historians  amoral,  egocentric techies  &quot;roam the quantum foam&quot;  search of a  colleague lost  a time-travel experiment  You won't regret 
What starts of with yet another promising Crichton novelbordering on innovative concepts  ideas, turns out to be a simpleplot involving a group of students who volunteer to go back  time  order to bring their professor back to the presentbr The characters are unidimensional  the plot weakens to a point where the whole book basically involves a hide  seek  chase game between the students  soldiers that is vaguely reminescient of a scooby doo cartoonbr True I have to admit that  was a page turner: I was reading as fast as I could hoping the next chapter would surprise me  actually be interesting  Well I was dead wrong  The ending is predictably nausiating  I was relieved to have reached  
Ive been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for some time, his novels combine the action  suspence of a blockbuster movie, but at the sametime not becoming a trashy \\"airport\\" novel Timeline is no exception doing for  timetravel what Jurassic Park did for genetics But there are problems  here, the characters are far to shallow, we are told that they are good   evil from the first paragraph, sides from which the characters rarely  deviate With the characters being so black  white  does mean that  this book is quite put downable  places Also Crichton's views on  affecting the future  this book are quite the opposite of the chaos  theory views that were preached  Jurassic Park The film will be great,  but the book could have been better
My first impression of the novel as I got into  was that  was basically a screenplay  the form of a novel, which is okay because now they will have an easy time following the book for the movie  BUT I still  had a very fun time reading this   the last 100 pages I couldn't put   down  br The premise is that a company called ITC has developed the  quantum technology that is a mystery to most people,  now they can send  literally ANYTHING back to different times  history   is not your  usual theory of time travel   will make you think a little  An  archeolical dig  restoration is underway  France  1999  The  archeologists are unearthing the remains of La Roque  Castlegard castles   the south of the country   the middle of the project, the Professor  Edward Johnston leaves for ITC unexpectedly Meanwhile back  France, a  monestary is uncovered  something shocking  unbelievable is found  burried  the ruins  An eyeglass lense, looking identical to the  Professor's   a note  his handwriting  br Soon they discover that is  really is from the Professor, dating all the way back to the fourteenth  centurybr Once more of the main characters travel to the fourteenth  century, the story evolves   picks up its pace right up until the last  pages  There is no shortage of action  gore,  you also get a  interesting look at what the Middle Ages may have been like  br Chrichton  is a wonderful story teller, but this book only deserves four stars because   his writing, all he really does  TELL you the story, he doesn't PUT  you  the middle of  as Stephen King  other real writers do  But, I  still love Chrichton's books, especially JURASSIC PARK  THE LOST WORLD   The thing he does best  his stories is keep you hooked with suspense We  really haven't seen a book with this originality since JURASSIC PARK    br Read the book,  setting all actual writing talent criticism aside,  enjoy  for what  is  Pure fun  adventure!
Michael Crichton is a scientist  a storyteller  Not everyone will grasp the science of the possibilities of quantum physics, time travel  parallel universes called multi-verses, but  is not required I enjoyed  the mental challenge,  began to second guess the probabilities, but all  one has to do to enjoy the book is simply suspend disbelief  get  involved with characters who are comprised of a variety of people who are  egocentric, devilishly cruel, intriguing as they find strength within  themselves they didn't know they had,  charmingbr How do you find a  missing colleague who inserted a message for help  a 600 year old  document, keep your head on (literally),  get home?  Imagine being  transported to a ancient world that is as real to you as a telephone only  to find that the world is as you imagined, but very different  laden  with more pitfalls than you thoughtbr  thenthe transport device that  took you into the past is gonebr The intellectual discussions about the  valorous knights  battles (1357 Dordogne  South France) fade as the  reality of being  this world kills  threatens those who enter  Crichton's events are based  historical informationbr The beginning of  the story is hard to follow because there are many characters that are  introduced with their own story lines, but they do fold together the way a  medieval tapestry does--with a lot of details  Well researched  detailsbr This book makes you remember that you should always beware of  what you ask for, you might get  I thoroughly enjoyed the book
Even though I possess a science background, I found the general premise to be be confusing  never properly explained  The ending was hurried  dissapointing
Wow, this was a truly awful book  's filled with long, pedantic,  patently false scientific explanations that are painful to read  The characters are completely hollow  the story just plods along without any  direction  What little development there is is completely implausible  A  book that should not have been written
Let's look once Crichton is a suberp researcher Nobody can say otherwise  this book he descri bed medieval, feudal France excellently When you read the book you see Dordogne area was described  every little detail  The theories  tellings about Quantum physics shows that Crichton had  done its homework well about this subject too - however some of them are  arguable especially &quot;time paradox es&quot; I am not satisfied about  that  br     But decription of characters had flaws The only character I  understood fully was Christopher Hughes The others like Kate Ericson   Andre Ma rek had some blanks as well as the connections between them The  book itself is very enjoyable  excitting , non-stop motion especially   mid dle  last parts I am sure its movie would be made br      As an  amateur history researcher I totally agree with a saying  the book  &quot;Ýf you don't know history , you don't know anything&quot;
This book was a very mysterious book Michael Crichton's Timeline kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time , I  could never put the book down  was a mixture of technology, the past,  friendship  was  about risking your own life to save someone else's life Timeline really  let you get a glimse of the past  really helped me to understand what  the past was like  was a very interesting book, you definately should  take the time to read !
Wait for the movie - that is all that this excuse for a book was written forbr MC takes a reasonable attempt at a story line (dubious science allows timetravel - historians get to travel back to a site  medieval  France they have been working  get to take part  a battle before  returning to the present  the nick of time) then absolutely fails to  develop any realistic characters  The 'science' is aimed squarely at the  chronically uneducated  although he has obviously researched medieval  France fairly well (looking at the biography), he fails to transform this  into anything compellingbr  you want a book that blends science with  history - try Cryptonomicon by Stevens
I love European history,  I love science, so Michael Crichton really does  for me  He has a fascinating way of weaving intelligent  thought-provoking ideas from both disciplines into a story for popular  tastes   Timeline he basically follows the same formula he follows   his other books: He takes some cutting-edge science so far out that the  average reader doesn't know  's plausible  just imaginary  finds a  way to recreate everybody's greatest fantasy with , but alas, the plan  goes awry  our heroes find themselves  mortal danger   Unfortunately,  his writing strategy  this book is appallingly transparent to anyone  who's read Jurassic Park  Sphere  Congo  The Andromeda Strain  any  of his other books  After reading about so many ridiculous fights   battles  adventures that our heroes encounter, one begins to grow weary   Still, the historical context  the scientific backbone make the story  come alive  make  well worth reading  Honestly, I loved the book   I recommend  to you!   was just way too predictable  cliche  But  Crichton knows what audiences want  he delivers that  He obviously  wrote the book with a movie  the back of his mind, but I would say based  on his track record, the book is MUCH better than the movie will be  So  read the book
Michael Crichton writes quite vividly  his most recent fictional work  Timeline lives up to his earlier works of Sphere  The Andromena Strain as far as a mix of science  adventure  I thought that the background he  gives us  quantum physics is enough to easily grasp the ideas that he his  trying to convey, without turning this book into a textbook on physics   Also, his idea of involving non science characters into the plot made   much more palatable to those of us with only a reasonable interest   science  All  all, Crichton has again written a novel compelling for  anyone with a sense of adventure, an enjoyment of history,  a desire for  intrigue
Crichton's best work,  my opinion, is non-fiction  His TRAVELS is a great read  provides insight into what makes him tick  He has great plot ideas, but the writing is too predictable  contrived  's like  looking at a photo of a great meal  a magazine  then eating the  paper--not at all satisfying, but the CONCEPT is great  TIMELINE is,   anything, worse than RETURN TO JURASSIC PARK,  whatever that bomb was  called   reads like a bad TV drama  I think I will consign Crichton to  the same place I put another author I was intrigued with, until I read  enough of his books to learn there wasn't a whole lot there--Kurt Vonnegut
Overall a good book, especially  you are a technology buff like me He did pretty good research regarding to date Quantum theory, but there were too many holes  unanswered questions Why when they sent the group of  scientists back, did they have to arrive 'after' the Dr
Hmmmmsomething's wrongbr I was a little suprised when I read &quot;The Lost World&quot;  was very obviously a screenplay for the next Jurassic Park movie &quot;Oh well,&quot; I thought, &quot;I guess  there's enough  money involved, even I would sell out&quot;br But twice?br Nearly  everything I have read from Michael Crichton has been brilliantly written   plausible,  only just The ability to write this pseudo-science  fiction has been a winning strategy for so long that this book came as a  real suprisebr A multi-billionaire has sponsored an effort that has  resulted  a time travel machine that allows scientists to visit France   the middle ages So far, so good However, a group of American college  students, excavating an old castle, are suddenly swept up  a crisis when   turns our their professor has vanished The evil billionaire asks that  they go back  time  find himjust after they have excavated their  professors eyeglasses from their site!br Sorry   sounds like I'm being  sarcastic, but this book is a screenplay  reads like a film, not a book  The time machine description is interesting,  good, but the events  surrounding the adventure are awful made for a Hollywood  blockbusterbr Going back  time, the students wear little ear pieces that  immediatly translate medieval French into English They manage to pass as  citizens  mingle freely, interacting perfectlytoo easily They even  manage to joust  a tournament!br There is no suspense  the outcome is  sadly predictable Too bad, I'm afraid 'll make an interesting movie
This book was a disappointment  Although, I think that I will like the movie because so much of the book requires the visual senses Michael Crichton is a gifted writer  one that I generally enjoy but this was not  one of his best works
This is a great book As always MrCrichton doesn't just make up the theories  facts but carefully researched them before writting them down This book is hard to put down  not booring I am surprised to see a lot  of bad reviews on amazon by assure a future reader that the reviews are  nonesense  that this is one of the best books of the last decade   Michaels personal best of all time Still this book may be too violent for  some readers  I recommend you at least be 12 years old to read this  book
I have always seen Michael Crichton as a kind of pulp fiction writer for scientists His writing is a bit bland  his characters remain one-dimensional (Crichton has a habit of referring to his characters by  their last name) His stories are fun as long as you expect simple  entertainment Don't pick up his books expecting poetry  insights into  the human experience His trademark style is explaining relatively complex  scientific ideas  order to advance his plot Many of his stories take  place on the paradigm shift of a particular scientific field  Jurassic  Park  was genetics  cloning;  The Andromeda Strain  was  microbiology ( something along those lines);  Sphere  was  extraterrestrial intelligence;   Timeline  is time travel (I forget  the scientific jargon for )  is similar to Jurassic Park  some of  's plot points  is therefore a little predictable at times The story  concerns a handful of archeologists who travel to medieval France using  high-powered equipment The action gets off to a good start but is not  spectacular The most interesting parts of the book are the little side  plots about the possible effects of time travel Board members discuss how  to market their discovery by recording historical events  they find that  their historical figures are different from what they expected The plot is  otherwise predictable but is also entertaining as a simple book for the  beach
I really expected a LOT more from crichton His usual combination of science  adventure can be found  this book  makes  very compelling  a (VERY) fast read The problem with this book is that the  storyline is not believable For instance,  the story is not about time  travel, how come things done  the past have an affect on the present?  There are many gaps  the story, not something usually seen  crichton  books I was a little disappointed
One thing about Michael Crichton's books is that you learn something new every time  Timeline, you get a crash course  life  death  14th Century France Our heroes venture there via an ingenious time travel  device to rescue thier comrade Of course, things go wrong quickly  the  rescue proves a bit more difficult than expected A page turner,  definitely
I found the book very disappointing The idea was too similar to Jurassic Park for comfort (ie secretive hi-tech company meddling  things  does not fully understand)  the plot was tedious  repetitive  Not  recommended, which is a pity as Michael Crichton's books are often very  exciting
Michael Crichton's &quot;Timeline&quot;  is an adventure story featuring modern young historians who are transported to medieval  France; a setting whose inhabitants hold values  assumptions  not widespread  millenial  America As with his other works, Crichton shows respect for the reader's  intelligence by offering up - at the layman's level - a plausible scenario  by which space-time travel might be possible  , beyond the nailbiter  pace of the action, he succeeds  relating a sense of the lives   habitats of fourteenth-century France   Wm F Buckley, no doubt, will be  swelling with pride when he learns what Yale's hands-on history people were   doing centuries before Harvard was even founded  The rest of us may  content ourselves feasting on a delicious adventure marinated   revisionist history  spiced with the latest technology from  twentieth-century physics  Those who enjoyed Mallory's book on King  Arthur, say,  &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, should consider a whirl on the  roller-coaster of &quot;Timeline&quot;
I HAVE READ A SMALL EXCEPT FROM THE BOOK, FOUND  TO BE AN EXCITING STORYI HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED STORIES THAT DEAL WITH TIME TRAVELL I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO FEELS AS I DO THANK YOU
Science fiction based on fact  set  the not too distant future is a hallmark of Michael Crichton  The story will entertain readers who enjoy science fiction adventures as well as those who enjoy period pieces set   medieval Europe  The science is based on enough fact to make the story  interesting  The story itself moves quickly,  keeps you  suspense   There are some holes  the company owner's character, which do not make  sense except as representing a steriotype; but that is minor criticism of  an otherwise fun, fast read
Just enough technology  history to enjoyable learn quite a bit!  Authoritatively makes a stance on history  explores possible future technologies  No unrealistic  implausible scenes  the whole book  Reads just like his movies
Crichton knows how to tell a good story, so that you're sorry when 's over,  he does so here  However, the linkage between the 20th Century action  the 14th century action isn't as clear, the ending is a bit  disappointing,  overall, the book is just too short  That's right, too  short  There isn't room for the kind of textural development that this  sort of book really requires, the kind that Harry Turtledove excels at   You won't be disappointed  this book, but  Crichton had worked a little  more  would have been great instead of simply good
This is the sixth Crichton I've read  I can usually write the same review for every one His storyline ideas are incredible  Very believable science fiction ideas which translate over to movies well  His character  development however is his weak point  I found this to be true  Timeline  as well  This story was not his best either, leaving you wondering what  the purpose of all this was by the time you are finished  A fairly quick  reading book  not all bad, but I can't give  a rousing endorsement  either
Timeline is  my opinion one of Crichton's better books   Its a great blend of the usual Crichton formula but I found  highly original  clever   This time, the thrust is on Quantum theory applied to the middle  ages, but I was struck by how well Crichton was able to make the science  fiction believeable ( understandable even to the layman)  I was  particulary impressed that many of the beliefs  suppositions the  historians had about the middle ages turned out to be simply wrong--makes  you really wonder  what we learned  school on any subject will  withstand the test of timebr Anyway, what's especially good about this  book is that the characters are much better developed  more believeable  than some of his other ones   Aside from &quot;Chris&quot;, who really  didn't draw a lot of my sympathy, I thought the other characters were not  only realistic, but quite likeable  many respects   I thought some of  Crichton's other characters  Lost World  Jurassic Park were rather  weakbr The book had a great pace  with all the usual twists  turns,  I found myself squirming with amazement, completely caught up  the world  that Crichton had created   br Lastly, this book has a pretty decent   satisfying ending
This book is very absorbing,  Crichton usually makes his science seem plausible I was very intrigued by &quot;Sphere,&quot;  the novel &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; made my blood run cold-- scared me a lot more  than the movie didbr But &quot;Timeline&quot; is sloppy An architect  refers to a diagram of a monastery  says that  shows apsidal chapels,  when  fact,  does not (the diagram is reproduced  the book) The  architect  a historian are talking about the putative location of the  monastery's refectory-- a few pages later are referring to the same room  as the &quot;rectory&quot; (which of course makes no sense to begin with,   that context) Archaelogists come across a mass burial on the site of a  monastery,  the author says, &quot;But there were strange things about  this--they were all men&quot; (well, duh, the population of a monastery  usually is)  &quot;they had died of arrow wounds, but no battle had been  fought at the monastery&quot; So? The battle didn't have to be fought  right there; the monastery was simply where they were brought for burial  Irritating little lapses like this occur rather frequently throughout the  bookbr Other faults are more serious One medieval widow is such a  consummate plotter that she makes Michael Corleone look like a boy scout;  yet one of the main characters, having known her for less than 24 hours   having seen little of her but her cunning, inexplicably falls  love with  her,  we are to believe that they live happily ever after Perhaps   really does work out that way, but  is obvious that the author expects  the reader to endorse this decision,  that really doesn't make a great  deal of sensebr A scientist attempts to explain quantum physics to a group  of historians He shows that experiments  optics show that there must be  multiple universes which may randomly affect ours Perhaps this is a  logical surmise,  my knowledge of science is weak, but for me, his  explanations raised more questions than they answered  photons from an  alternate universe can bump light &quot;out of the way&quot;  ours, does  that mean that an oil slick from an alternate universe can suddenly   randomly make my street slippery, so that I have a wreck?br The scientists  go on to explain that teleportation is achieved by analogy with faxing But  faxing is nothing but transmission of electronic signals; 's not the  whole thing There must be material at the other end to recreate the  image-- even after recreation, the entire result is simply a copy  Crichton wants us to believe,  this story, that &quot;faxing&quot; people  actually reconstitutes real humans &quot;at the other end&quot; For me,  the analogy broke downbr Weakest of all, for me, is the way Crichton  faces-- rather, fails to face--the peculiar dilemmma of time travel:   we could visit the past, how could we know that whatever we did was not   fact altering the past for the worse? The movie &quot;Frequency&quot; at  least faces this issue squarely: a man saves his father's life,  the  past, but  so doing, alters his mother's life so that she comes to the  notice of a serial killer who would otherwise never have encountered  herbr Crichton simply denies that the issue is real at all When one of  the characters is asked, &quot;But  I went back  time  killed my  grandfather, so that I was never born, wouldn't that be paradoxical,&quot;  he simply replies that you probably couldn't kill your grandfather, because  you might not find him,  your gun would misfire,  you might be  arrested, etc Pretty lame,  my opinionbr  the end, as one of the  reviewers has already said, you realize that what you are reading, all   all, is a rather brutal description of medieval mayhem  again, there  are a couple of howlers thrown , such as a smart young female historian  with a fine education seriously saying &quot;My hero&quot; toa fellow she  is interested  Other touches, such as the decapitation-prone mad knight  guarding the Green Chapel, seem to be an obvious borrowing from &quot;Sir  Gawain&quot;--  is impossible to tell  Crichton is even aware of  thisbr Crichton certainly did do some homework for this book,  he makes  some bold  interesting claims--for instance, that broadsword combat was  not slow  cumbrersome, as we might imagine, but quick as fencing,   that medieval knights were not as small as we think they were (Then why  are doorways to private rooms  medieval buildings so short?)br  any  case, there are interesting points about the book, but  needed a better  editor, perhaps one who was not overawed by the author's name   reputationa fellow she  is interested  Other touches, such as the decapitation-prone mad knight  guarding the Green Chapel, seem to be an obvious borrowing from &quot;Sir  Gawain&quot;--  is impossible to tell  Crichton is even aware of  thisbr Crichton certainly did do some homework for this book,  he makes  some bold  interesting claims--for instance, that broadsword combat was  not slow  cumbrersome, as we might imagine, but quick as fencing,   that medieval knights were not as small as we think they were (Then why  are doorways to private rooms  medieval buildings so short?)br  any  case, there are interesting points about the book, but  needed a better  editor, perhaps one who was not overawed by the author's name   reputation
I really liked this bookI did, but I found myself reading The Naked God by Peter Hamilton more often than picking up Timeline (I was reading both at the same time, time constraints) Michael Chriton's most recent books  have incorporated a futuristic, but eerily easily acheiveable technology  with a dangerous &quot;All heck breaks loose&quot; pessimistic situation I  really like his straight to the point, non-fluff writing style, but this  book took  way too far I mean, yes a quick read is nicebut this book  even had grammar errorshow is that?  Nice story, I'd rate this as a  5050 buy Like my title, Good ideaBad Execution
I really loved Michael Chrichton's other books, so I was excited to see a new title on the shelves  I was expecting Quantum Science with a history flavor, but this book focuses on a small fragment of history with very  little time spent on quantum mechanics  The novel describes how the  characters are &quot;quantum disassembled&quot;  reassembled  the past  ( some other universes' past) by some mysterious extra-universe force  I  have recently read some material about quantum teleportation  I thought  this would be an extension of that  I was confused  a little  disappointed with how the science was handledbr The writing, however, is,  as always, superb  most of the characters are believable  I had a hard  time putting the book down  the characters' troubles had me hooked I  found the mad scientistevil capitalist bad guy, however, wasn't  consistanly nasty enough  He is portrayed as a genius ( a bit of a Bill  Gates clone), but is easily thwarted  the end  The &quot;Brave  Hero&quot; character seems a bit hard to believe too br The historical  setting was very well crafted  You could picture the characters  this  mideval setting, struggling to understand how things worked  Even well  trained archeologists didn't have a clue how this society really worked   br  you are a Michael Crichton fan, you probably have this book already   not, you still might enjoy this history-text-come-to-life story  But   you are a SciFi fan, you are may be dissapointed by Timeline
Timeline is an excellent Crichton book  has all the ingredients to be one A good mixture of fantasy, science  adventure However I did miss something extra from the book, something that could have made  different  from the previous Crichton books The machine of the writer was working   put all the well-known Crichton ingredients into the book, but I think this  book, unlike the previous ones, would have required something special too
He's done  again!  Every book of Crichton's is great, but Timeline by far is the best  The action  plot development kept me up far into the night, unable to put  down  He excellently mixed science with story line  to keep anyone who reads this book guessing   you are a Crichton fan you  have got to read this book
I wasn't going to write a review of this book - there are already over 700 reviews, but I was compelled to because I JUST LOVE THIS BOOK  I am a scholar  professor of medieval art at a small college  I picked up this  book this summer as an outlet from my scholarly writing   has been a  joy  My father is a physicist,  I, as a historian, have never found  science &quot;my bag&quot; But this book, with  combination of history   sciencetechnology, has us conversing about quantum theory -- something  I never cared a whit about  This book also reminds us scholars -- though  no doubt many would find this beneath them -- that recreating the past is a  difficult thing to do,  one should not hold too fast to opinions   beliefs;  the end, we DO NOT KNOW   I say bravo - job well done
Michael Crichton has done  again He has succeeded  telling a story that is factually accurate  very believable although the story takes pace  a fictional setting I learned quite a bit about history  also a  bit about human nature  what is really the most important thing  life  What does existence all boil down to? What is the purpose of life?  the  Middle Ages as well as today, there is just ONE answer to this question  Read the book  you'll find outbr Great Job, Michael I will continue  to read your books
I love Michael Crichton I hang out for each new release, diappointed when I don't get my fixbr I like books that mix facts with fiction One that teaches me something,  fools me into believing that  just could  happenbr This is typical Crichton, so  didn't disappoint me at all You  could see the plan to make  into a box office movie, but  didn't stoop  as low as Lost World, which tried far too hard to attract a young audience  He has obviously done his research,  I had that sense of learning as I  turned the pages As usual he made each page one to keep you turningbr Not  a stunning novel as far as plot, but  you like Crichton's other work, you  will enjoy this
I look to Michael Crichton books for what they are: fun, light, summertime reading  &quot;Timeline&quot; is immensely enjoyable  The old, standard formula is there, but that is why I buy these books  what makes the ride  such a treat  Also: Kudos to Crichton for easing into his story a  reference to the obscure but fascinating medieval text &quot;Sir Gawain   the Green Knight&quot;  Pleasurable indeed!
I loved this book Being a past Crichton fan, I have to say that &quot;Timeline&quot; is one of his best  &quot;Timeline&quot;, Crichton melds the past  present  an array of technology  tradition 's  clear Crichton did a tremendous amount of research for this book,  the  science could not be more up to date  This book is a necessity for any  reader who likes Fantasy  Science Fiction Thriller's!
This book was an excellent book  was brilliantly written  was historically accurate I would recommend this book for anybody who likes suspense, drama,  history
As a former Yale graduate student, at least I had something  common with the (overly numerous) characters, but they still didn't hold my attention The story was pretty pointless,  by the end I didn't care what happened  Skip  unless you're desperate for shallow entertainment He does get  extra points for ridiculing Yale's imitation gothic architecture
Interested  a book  which historians go back  time to the middle ages?br Skip this one,  read the real thing: Connie Willis's &quot;Doomsday Book&quot; I can't rave about that one too much Read the  Amazon reviews  you think that I'm exaggeratingbr &quot;Timeline,&quot;  otoh, just reads like a pale imitation, dumbed-down for the mass market  's a shame that because Crichton has the big name that he'll sell many  more copies than will the real thingbr I had just read the first few  chapters when I was able to guess the ending  every plot turn   &quot;Timeline&quot;  you want your books predictable  tame, read  this one  you want ideas, character development, science fiction,   emotions, check out &quot;Doomsday Book&quot; instead
This book is the brilliant combination of the life of 16th centuary  that of 21st centuaryThe book displays perfect mixture of science fiction  a historyOne of the best quality of the book is that  got a superb end Which is a rare thng for Crichton
Congratulations for an american novelist even so wellknown as Michael Crichton to try doing new  the style of making techno-thriller Modernity  history of medieval France are very interesting for a french reader,  who have red all the books of Crichton, but also books of Clancy, Ludlum,  Cussler, Forsyth  so on The trip to the past  specially during the  &quot;Guerre de cent ans&quot; one hundred war, that Barbara Tuchmann  considered as the calamitous 14th century, is very couragesous for an  american writer The american readers are not specially competent   medieval history of Europe! The site of Dordogne that I know very well, is  also original,  I consider that Crichton  doing this effort to work on  that topic,   France at this period, confirms his quality of very  great nevelist,  not specially  thriller  this book, the details   the relation of some points of the war against the english are correct  The site is correctly describded,   this book is transformed into  movie, I hope Crichton will come  Dordogne to take some images
I enjoyed reading Timeline, although I thought  was typical Crichton   seemed to fall a little flat after Jurasic Park  However, some of that feeling could be that I read  on audio cassette,  an abridged copy at  that   was exciting enough to keep me to the end,  I do recommend   to Crichton fans  to those who like adventure, fantasy  time-travel  novels
The storyline of this book was great- the idea that using quantum physics a person could move through time  ways never imagined is an excited direction to take  The only thing that this book lacked was substance on  the technology side of things  At the beginning of the book, I was pleased  by the alternating focus from tech to story to tech But as the book  progressed, there was less tech  more story; I felt that the middle of  the book,  anywhere, needed more focus on the tech side of things  But,  I still enjoyed the story  There just seemed to be room (although maybe  not much) for more extensive use of technology
Michael Crichton's &quot;Timeline&quot; was an extremely entertaining book   is a book for anyone, wheter you like historical books, archeology, technology,  just like Crichton's style This book is for  you TImeline is most definitely his best book since Jurrasic Park
fun read, very enjoyable, esp character development  view of 14th cent worldbr Requires a *lot* more suspension of disbelief than most of his others  the modern-day aspects faxes copy, as would his quantum  machine  There is no public notion that we have little left to learn   Patently ridiculous that &quot;one person couldn't change history&quot;,  esp  that person was a historian  These detract from his credibility  about the 14th centbr But then, this isn't a history  science  even  philosophy text 's good entertainment
Timeline is one of the few books I've read that keep getting better until the very end Everything about this book is great The action barely ever stops The only problem I see with this book is that Chricton seemed to  give up on some of the charactors from the beggining,but that is just a  minor flaw,that doesnt really effect this book  anyway
What Crichton appears to have done with this book is simple He took JURASSIC PARK, changed the characters,  altered the science discussed from genetic engineering to quantum mechanics Overall, a predictable book,  but interesting nonethelessbr The main dissapointment the book presented  was that the characters of Chris, Kate,  Andre were hardly given enough  time to develop fully They were immediately thrust into Crichtonian  situation after Crichtonian situation, until the end of the book eventually  arrivedbr Overall, an entertaining read, but don't expect a rich,  compelling plot  that's what you want, purchase THE LORD OF THE RINGS by  JRR Tolkien
Yes, I admit, the beginning of this book is kind of slow Crichton has to explain a few things  set up some odds  ends  is a bit of a pain to get through that part  On the other hand,  you stick with , you  will shortly find TIMELINE to be an incredibly entertaining  fast moving  read  I do not think that Crichton expects us to attend to the concept of  &quot;quantum physics&quot;  time travel other than as devices with  which to spark off another of his exciting, nearly plausible tales Just as  he did with JURASSIC PARK, he takes a believable scientific possiblity   then weaves  a flagrantly exotic tale, for fun I think he is a master at  doing this,  I loved this book  is set initially  the present   flashes back  forth classily to the 1300'swith a few double crosses  thrown  You do learn about the earlier time, with Crichton's apparently  effortless store of information* bolstering his plot effectively  's not  really about real people,  real feelings,  values's just pure  entertainment on a more elegant than usual level  I would read this at the  beach  hold my head up high !br best, Jeanbr *'s not really  effortless--get a load of the bibliography at the end!
This book reads like a script for a motion picture, with its last minute escape The look inside 15th Century France was interesting, but the science behind  was difficult to understand  hard to believe  I have  enjoyed most of Michael Crichton's books, but this seemed to be written  with the big buck payout  mind  not the enjoyment of the reader
This is a very good book that shows Crichton's talent at researching a subject before he writes the book For those of you who think this is psuedo-science, take a look  the bibliography  try reading some of the  books Crichton used to research the subject This book has a great  scientific base behind br The action keeps you turning pages until you  think &quot;Hey, what happened I'm done?&quot; The story has a great  structure with many suprises along the way
The story is really a nice idea,   is written fluently  very interesting; but the logic behind the whole story has some severe flaws MC claims time paradoxes are irrelevant, because every 'world' is existing at  the same time (he calls  &quot;multiverse&quot;, where people can jump  through wormholes using quantum technology) So far, so good This implies  that changes  the past do NOT change our current time BUT: That means an  object lost  the past will also NOT appear  our time ! The Professor  (Mr Johnston) looses his glasses when travelling back,  writes a  &quot;help me&quot; note into some documents His students find those  (glasses  words) some 500 years later  a cave at the archeologic site,  which causes them to ask what's going on  all worlds are existing at  once, they wouldn't have found anything;  they find something, the whole  'time paradox' idea starts up againbr I cannot commend on the medieval  things, although they seem a bit over-exaggerating the violence of that  time -  was violent, but   would have happened the Michael Crichton  way, mankind would probably not have survived at all
Despite the negative remarks of the most recent reviewers, I have to say that this was the most enjoyable Crichton book I read since Jurassic Park ( I've read them all)br Crichton is probably the only writer today who  would dare to tackle quantum physics  medieval France  the same book,   he pulls off a splendid adventurebr Having always been fascinated by  the age of chivalry  knights  armour, Timeline's recreation of the  medieval world certainly made for enjoyable reading br Being a former  physics student, I also read the passages explaining quantum mechanics   the concept of &quot;multiverses&quot; (parallel universes) closely  was  fascinated (though not entirely convinced!) by the idea of  &quot;transcribing people through the multiverses&quot; (the form that  &quot;time travel&quot; takes  this book)br Although I agree that some  of the plot &quot;twists&quot; are somewhat predictable, I'm not  complaining as  makes the reader feel a little cleverer! br Requiring you  to think  the beginning  then hitting you with a whole load of silly  fun at the end, this book meshes science  adventure like no other   should not be missed by any Crichton fan ( indeed, anyone else!)
Michael Crichton's &quot;Timeline&quot; reads like like a good author on autopilot ( perhaps one with movie, merchandising,  multimedia rights on his mind)  The scientific premise of the novel has the potential to be  a compelling story (ala Jurassic Park), but MC litters the story with so  many pseudo-scientific contradictions, cliched characters,  hackneyed  plot twists that the end result is a story that might make some Zena fans  cringebr Crichton's so-called explantion of the irrelevancy of time  parodoxes is a laughably shallow 1 12 pages long,  is based on 3rd-  rate logic that a child could easily rebut  Almost all of the major plot  elements are stale  telegraphed,  some of the dialogue  plot  twists would make a dime store romance novelist blushbr The end result is  passably entertaining--but then again I was home sick  didn't have very  high standardsbr You can do better Mike  A LOT better
Ever since seeing Jurassic Park, Crichton was one of my favorite authors  Even before I read any of his books, I loved his stories  I finally read Sphere which while interesting could not compare to the pure adrenaline  pumping, swash-buckling fun of Jurassic Park  I picked up Timeline was the  hope that  could be as good as I knew Crichton could write The first 100   so pages masterfully introduce you to the characters  remain  suprisingly interesting  Once the time traveling begins the action picks  up  the sense of wonder  excitement that made Jurassic Park a classic  return  top form  Part Back to the Future, part Gladitor, part Jurassic  Park, part Spielberg,  all fun Timeline's story treads the thin line of  probability  fun, informative  exciting simultaneously   is  clearly one of Crichton's best  is a must read to all fans of action,  adventure,  books  general
Entertaining story but I agree with the other reviewers: Crichton contradicts himself terribly with the multiverse thing, which could have gotten the characters out of some situations nicely  Translator ear-pieces  were indeed a joke  some great character development opportunities were  missing  About 20 more pages could have done much of this without changing  the feeling of length too much  The exact idea of the theme park was not  well described  the long speeches from the billionaire Donigan were  unnecessary, especially given the predictable end  A few more nice twists  could've been added  I wonder  the inevitable movie will pick up on  them?
I cannot understand why people get worked up over the fact that the author  may not fully understand quantum mechanics So what, its a novel a story  for goodness sake!  Isn't he entitled to a little artistic licsense  I  found this book a real page turner  was gripped from start to finish   Can't wait for the movie!
I think Crichton did a good job on this book, just like he has with all of his books The book has a great mixture of true-to-life science,  medieval times I personally like the book because of this  the fact  that Crichton studies up on subjects before he writes about them to make  the reading experience better I like the book =)
Very slow at the start, but after the first 100 pages  picks right up
I couldn't put this book down once I picked  up  was full of such interesting facts  fiction  was definatly worth the read
As you may have gathered from other reviews, the book comes on strong right away  I found myself fascinated by the science behind the story (as I did with Jurrasic Park)  This lasted about 13rd the way through the  book  The &quot;nick of time&quot; plot will surely make the book more  &quot;movie ready,&quot; but is totally unnecessary for the story itself   br The characters were quirky, but not terribly unrealistic  I found their  relentless luck a little unnerving, the type of luck that you see  a  Jackie Chan movie!  br This book is still a great read, don't get me wrong  -  starts out FANTASTIC  then just dwindles down to above average  worth picking up  you like the writing style
Timeline is definitely not one of Crichton's best works, but  isn't horrible either  I give brownie points to the author for trying to create a 'thriller' out of theoretical quantum mechanics, but he tried too hard to  make such a complex theory accessible to any Joe on the street   I realize  that is what bestselling authors are supposed to do to entertain the  audience, but  lowered the rank of this book considerably  my mind   While the medeival scenes were often engaging  enjoyable to read, the  characters of the students (Kate, Andre,  Chris) were quite annoying   unconvincing Their adventures were beyond far-fetched  unlikely,   most of their exploits smacked of your typical Saturday morning cartoon  where the good guys always end up winning by some miraculous intervention  So, although Crichton is one of my favorite authors, his attempt at quantum  time travel  this novel was fairly feeble  unpersuasive
I was very entertained by this book I know a lot of the other reviewrs have been dissapointed by this but I just could not put  down  shows us a facinating look at medevil life  you really feel like you have been  there The plot is great  well paced  the technical data that Chriton  fans love is there Check  out
First Crichton book I've read   his others are like this then I'm sure he will be ever grateful to Hollywood screenwriters The topic was promising  the first third was a good read but then quickly turned to  dribble Wait for the movie
Si bien Timeline es un libro muy intenso y que se lee rpidamente, la verdad es que deja bastante que desear en cuanto a la profundidad de los personajes, no son mas que la excusa para plantear dos cosas 1 Tecnologia  futuristica de ultima generacion, con miles de millones de dolares por  detras 2 Una retrovision de la etapa medieval, con la pretension de hacer  una revision historica y de alguna manera, modelar la forma de vida  &quot;real&quot; de aquella epoca Pero el conjunto del libro queda en un  monton de escenas apenas interconectadas, PERFECTAS para hacer una pelcula  (la intencin no tan oculta supongo del autor) Rapido para leer, buenas  ideas, pero no demasiado explotadas
Its obvious that the amount of research for this book must have been immense  While the book delivers some interesting moments, the author must have just gotten tired of writing at the end,  contrived the ending you  would expect, after reading the previous chapters  No surprises, no weird  twistsbr Still an interesting  entertaining book, but, 's a formula  book,  he's plainly writing to interest Hollywood  the screenplay  versionbr Creighton's a brilliant man,  his books often display the  real depth to his mind This one could have had much more depth to 
This excellently written novel will keep you flipping pages as quickly as you can just to keep up with the action  I can't wait to read  again!
I do like most of Crighton's other work but found that this book's plot was so similar to Jurasic Park  was extremly annoying I think this book was written with  movie  computer game paychecks  mind
This book has so many elements that make  a compelling read, that I almost hate to mention things like shallow characterization  predictability of plot  just-too-convenient situations So let me dwell  on what I DID like: Crichton's typically well-reseached  imaginitive  premise A tasty combination of not-too-deep science   not-too-complicated SciFi, wrapped  a historically accurate   educational package Action that moves at a rapid pace Settings   situations that are just BEGGING to be made into a movie (I just saw  &quot;Gladiator&quot; this weekend,  I can imagine what the Hollywood  special effects people could do to create the medieval world of this  book!) So, the bottom line is READ , but don't expect anything more than  a fun time that will leave you ever so  slightly unsatisfied when you  finish
I think of Crichton as a master of &quot;science versimilitude&quot; as well as a superior craftsman of the straight out thriller   Well, not this time The science here is a weak  inconsistent hodge-podge to explain  the time travel (  Crichton himself says so  his Acknowledgements )    The characters here are the usual interchangeably forgettable group of  every Crichton novel    Only the action scenes  cliffhangers are above  average  , at that, will work better as a movie than a book  So,  overall, this one rates an OK, but we have come to expect better from this  seaoned writer
Michael Chrichton is one of my favorite techno-authors He has demonstrated his abilities with such novels from Andromeda Strain to Airframe to Jurassic Park,  has demonstrated his human  social  insights  such as Rising Sun  Disclosure  He can do them all So when  I picked up Timeline  the hardcover, I expected a good read   I  wasn't disappointed But  wasn't the read I expected Timelline is  Crichton's HISTORICAL obligato,  as a well established  talented  author, his Droit du Maestro He can write about anthing he wants at this  point  his career  He's earned that rightbr As a story about knights   ladies, castles  kings, battles  sieges, byzantine intrigue   brutal violence  Crichton dispells some myths  misconceptions about the  &quot;dark&quot; ages br What did fall short was the promise of technical  detail This was no Jurrasic Park, technonerds I thought this was going to  be about molecular hightech But science, real  speculative,  was only  used as a rather thinly sketched vehicle for the time-ex machina, to get  where he wanted to go: the past  This is mainly a novel about medieval  times  to that extent  was well drawn from an apprarently exhaustive  research effort by the author   to be fair  has an ending that pulls  back to the technical side of time travel That is, the story wouldn't have  worked without the technology But science  hightech this is not  Maybe  he should just write a straight historical novel  forget the time  travel?
As predictable as San Diego weather  sprouting more recipes than Julia Child, &quot;Timeline&quot; will appeal to every reader nostalgic for Frank  Joe Hardy  The characters here are their archaeological equivalent: to  say they are one-dimensional begs for the possibility of less than one  dimension to adequately describe them  This would require a quirk  the  physical world, with which &quot;Timeline&quot; abounds   fact,  Crichton's articulation of how time travel might be possible is the book's  only saving grace  From there (about midway through),  descends into a  series of scenes that read like treatments for the movie  will inevitably  become  How surPRISED we are that the good guys live  the bad ones die!   How unUSUAL that the 'Timeline' clicks down to the FINAL SECOND before the  dramatic rescue!  How enlightening to find that knights had halitosis!  Do  crack the cover  you're so inclined  Just, please, wake me when 's  over
&quot;Timeline is going to be a box office smash&quot;       This is what I found myself thinking whilst reading Michael Crichton's latest novel I'm absolutely certain that this book will be made into a movie Right from the  first couple of chapters I found myself  the casting couch, thinking  which ActorActress was going to be  the film Lets hope that this  Screenplay about Quantum Physics will be a tadge better than the one about  the talking Gorilla (nuff said)
With \\"Timeline\\" Michael Crichton returns to the formula that made \\"The Andromeda Strain\\"  \\"Jurassic Park\\" so popular  By formula, however, I don't mean the story is predictable  Nor  is  just like the previously mentioned novels  But  you're a fan of  Crichton's works, you'll see the resemblancebr This novel works well  because is takes a far-fetched concept of science fiction  makes  almost believable with the use of complex technology  Meanwhile, such technology is explained so that the notion of time-travel doesn't just seem plausible,  's comprehensible  As usual, Crichton's extensive research of both the technology he employs  the time period the characters visit shines through  The book suffers from a few gratuitous thrills  simplistic  plot lines, but  still delivers a decently intriguing story
Thank's to Mr Crichton who had taught us with the new enlightment  understanding quantum world 's very promised field that will be happened sooner  later  just the matter of time for people to make a kind of  real 3D fax machine  quantum teletransportation But there's an odd   Timeline that I may not agree with the way Mr Crichton tell us about  time-paradox possibilities   has to be a better explanation than  Doniger's argument to Stern This stuff really confusing me after I had  finished that incredible story Most of all, I'm eager to watch the movie  about this novel
Timeline is a fun book to read  Like most of his books Crichton teaches the reader something about sciencethis book is no exception   while this isn't as good as some of his previous works is well worth reading
This book is the best Michael Crichton book ever written  Of course I've read them all,  I'd say he gets better over the years  My old favorite was Disclosure, then Airframe, then Timeline  Quantam mechanics is one of  my favorite studies,  is mentioned  the book  The ending is very  exciting  the epilogue is the best ending for Crichton ever  I loved  
I just read a movie - lots of action, a varied group of characters, exciting settings  I could visualize the &quot;clean room&quot; laboratories of the scientists  the dusty castles of the middle ages all   living color on the big screen with a full orchestral soundtrack  stirring the adrenaline with each page -  is  each scene?  I've loved  Crichton since I devoured  Andromeda Strain  one sitting many years ago   But, he's gotten a little too slick  I should have waited for the movie   Oh well, some director will surely outdo my imagination
Crichton's time travel thriller is an interesting exciting read A team of scientists is trapped  the Middle Ages,  must extricate themselves from a sticky situation using only their witsbr While the time travel  theory is interesting, the characters are a bit thin, as is sometimes the  case with Crichton novels Still, the detail on the Middle Ages is  excellent,  you really get a feel for living  the time  periodbr Recommended for Cricthon fans,  those seeking a different kind  of time travel story
I really enjoyed Timeline  Not the best Crighton book, but very good none the less   you enjoy his technical style you will enjoy this book  I couldn't help but adapting this book to a movie as I read   I just hope  they adapt Airframe first  don't ruin  like they need Jurasic Park
The concept was good, original, but just wasn't as good as some of Crichton's past books  Unfortunately  wasn't all that could  I was hoping for something great, but I was disappointed
Cette livre est un chose que je comprends comme un faux-ideologue ceci un grand horse a bout  Il n'y a pas de carrotes, mais pourquoi a Chrichton n'est-ce pas voulez les reassignements blu?  Et pourquoi faire-il la  premiere fois a gauche pour favour dans la salle a manger, exceptez pas de  creme broulez pour savoir les Elians chaud?  Apres de finir cette livre  j'ais manager mes mains et telephonez tout ma famille pour vous a ca,  &quot;Combien des angels que dancer sur la head d'un pin?&quot;  Elles n'a  savoir pas que de dit
When I read the book I thought Crichton was writing a made for tv movie  lacks the depth of some of his prevoius novels, though  is a departure from his usual fare I give  2 stars
As a avid fan of Michael Crichton  having read every book he wrote,  was with great interest that I opened his newest one, Timeline  A disappointing read  was, I got the impression he was simply fulfilling a contract requirement with a publisher  needed to get a new book to  press Oh 's all there; Crichton the master of relating obscure  scientific dogma  presenting   almost understandable laymans terms  to a new application,-the book was dull  His formula of technology  run-a-muck, destroying 's creator is time tested but for some reason does  not come off this time  His ending was predictable  seemed like he  reached the required number of pages  simply killed off the bad guy   provided a happy ending for the struggling scientists I still think his  best works are &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;  &quot;The Eaters of the  Dead&quot; Both books show more effort  imagination than anything he  has written since
Timeline was awesomely written on Chriton's part I could not stand to put  down! The characters seem so real  the adventure is enough to give someone a heart attack!  grabs the readers attention straight from the beggining, then builds up to a truly epic climax   keeps you guessing  the whole way through Chriton gets the book to a point when you can't  think about anything except what's going to happen next,   keeps you  wondering, &quot;are they going to make ?&quot;
Michael Crichton applied his knowledge of quantum physics  history very well  He showed an insight into those areas that I rarely see from any writer  I write books myself,  have to admit that I was a bit jealous  about the quality of his story  He has continued to uphold his fine  standard of story telling  mentally intrigueing concepts  This book  flows well  I an totally happy that I purchased   Get , read ,   pass  on  PS - I wouldn't give this book the award for best book  written by Michael (Congo was a bit better -  my opinion)  Thank you  ;-}
Feh Mike writes, what, a &quot;book&quot;  seven days This &quot;book&quot; [read filmscript treatment] is thin stuff Skin back the plot  here's the summary Chapter Oneish: Look there's a rock, a puddle,  a hole, a river, a bad guy Rest of book: Have characters fall into hole,  get out of hole, fall into puddle, get out of puddle, fall into river, get  out of river, fight with bad guy, kill bad guy Well, you get  No  character development to speak of,  really quite little interesting  interaction with historical setting The historical characters  their  relationships with each other are not developed at all Much of character's  actions are left unexplained,  there's a very obvious editorial gaff  when Kate escapes to a &quot;narrower&quot; ceiling beam that is actually  twice as wide Very sloppy, very quickly put together stuff Maybe good for  a dumb Hollywood flick, but for a book, this is gossamer thin stuff indeed
Ever since I happened upon \\"Congo\\" several years back I have been a Michael Crichton fan  I plow through every novel he churns out  Like just about everything else he has written, \\"Timeline\\" makes for easy plowing  Crichton manages to make even stress tests on an airplane fuselage  (\\"Airframe\\") compelling  But he's lost something   \\"Timeline\\" This  latest book tires to be \\"Jurassic Park\\" set  the middle ages, with modern  folk using a new science to travel there instead of using new science to  resurrect the past   Its not the triteness of the book that doesn't work -  Crichton has been using the same plot devices since \\"The Andromeda Strain\\"  - 's just that he's lost a little steam This is hinted at by the tired  title  even the bland cover (maybe you can judge a book this way)  Crichton usually works a new science into his every plot  The science  usually allows something to happen that couldn't happen otherwise    \\"Timeline,\\" quantum physics is used to travel through time (sort of)  But  the modern characters only travel into a story that could have happened  without them   The modern stuff is almost superfluous  That the modern  characters have an impact on the outcome is also superfluous - medieval  characters could have had a similar impact  Minus the gee-whiz science,  the fantasy story is well researched but not terribly imaginative  When I  finished reading \\"Jurassic Park,\\" \\"Sphere\\"  others, I felt like I had  read something special  \\"Timeline\\" doesn't leave that sense  's all too  ordinary,  fast paced  I'm left wanting more  But I guess that will  have to waitunless we can speed up time to the release of his next book
As usual, Crichton writes a great book that is enjoyable to read  is factually true He has never failed to leave out technical details that make sense to all  His quantum mechanics is sound, simply stretched a bit  to allow the novel to take place His immersion of the audience  a  medieval world is wonderfully done   you enjoyed Congo  Jurassic Park,  then I think you'll enjoy this one as well
Another Crichton - another megaseller that reads more like a film script than a novel I will never understand the ritual behind Mr Crichtons writing page turners which become a success as books only when they are  turned into films Is script-writing such a badly-paid job  Hollywood?  &quot;Timeline&quot; is another such example of a novel that has been  published  a state somewhere between text  movie The characters:  Hollywood The scenes, the setting: Hollywood Tension, yes -  you read  the book like a movie Michael Crichton is an expert  adapting his status   knowledge as a scientist to the pseudo-scientific expectations   fears of the public The degree to which he fulfills these expectations is  the degree to which &quot;Timeline&quot; can be called a success, yes What  Mr Crichton lacks, however, is the sense of the past a novelist like, for  example, Sir Walter Scott had But of course: writing historic novels today  means something different than  an age when the past was not a playground  for the media but something to be reconquered  order to understand the  society people lived  Michael Crichton may write about Europe  the  Middle Ages  the only criterion that really counts for him is what  people know about the Middle Ages from the movies  the scenery that has  clustered around the verdict of the Dark Ages  this he is very  successful, indeed  he is a very skillful author But haven't we had  all this before Isn't  just another book that can prove the life hidden   its texture only by transforming this life into action?
Not Crichton's best, but plenty of entertainment  this book  I found Timeline to be an exciting, imaginative story,  as usual for Chichton, a fast read  The story line requires an open mind,  no knowledge of  quantum physics  Once you get past the plausibility factor, 's a wild  ride through the middle ages of Chichton's imagination  I would definitely  recommend this one!
 typical Crichton fashion, you are not only entertained with a concise  decscriptive writing style that manages to make even mundane scientific facts entertaining, you actually learn a thing  two  the process   br Coming up short of the believability found  the majority of his other  science-based fiction, this one stretches a bit TOO far  the technical  time travel area   was certainly an original idea, however, to have the  characters travel back to Medieval France  One would think the hollywood  temptation would be to visit the Dinosaurs  oh waithe's aleady done  that onebr Overall,  was a very easy  enjoyable read
 wasn't a suprise that this book was very informative Michael Crichton continuously proves his knowledge  hard work at researching  each book he writes I have never taken a physics course  my life  certainly  don't understand these quantum physics theories I do, however, enjoy  learning about Medieval times Not only has Crichton showed knowledge on  these subjects, but he also managed to make a good book on them The book  was good, but not great The story seamed to repeat itself The characters  would continuously get  trouble, get out, get  trouble,  get out  They were all interesting problems  made you want to read to find their  solution, but  started to get trite The book was very interesting, but   would be better  Crichton cut out a few of the less important trials  of the group
Imagine stepping out of a time machine into the year 1357 You're  France during a civil war You have only thirty-seven hours to remain,  you don't make  back to your time machine by then you will be stuck  history forever Everyone is out to cut you to pieces  your future is   your own hands Outwitting your opponents is the key to your survival, but  don't be late for you travel homebr  Michael Crichton uses suspense to  hook the reader into Timeline The plot contains many dramatic sequences  with action packed drama at the turn of every page The author uses a  period of history to create  background information on his novel His  characters have so much depth to them; they seem to jump off the page into  real life  from of your eyes Michael's characters face real problems   their adventures so  forces them to become almost lifelike  the  reader's mind  Going from modern day to the 14th century, Michael utilizes  detail to create depth  characters; the clothes they wore, their language   speech  how they goverend themselves Using images that paint  pictures  reader's minds, he creates a relationship between the reader   the novel
The Hardy Boys team with Nancy Drew  battle Midaevil men with halitosis  The first part of the book is modestly entertaining, explaining the physics of time travel  The second is full of nothing so much as  Hollywood cliche  Crichton doesn't really write the second half--he  experiments with narrow escapes (we're SO surprised---Frank  Joe emerge  aLIVE!) to see which one Spielberg might favor  the inevitable movie  The villains  good guys are so predictably drawn that you almost hear  the Bernard Hermann music strike up when one of them menacingly scratches  his chin  's just all too silly  's all been done before--just ask  Franklin W Dixon  Wait for the movie, then wait for the video
I enjoyed the first half of this book, but  got completely bogged down  the second half Found myself getting bored  racing through pages  hopes that the plot would start to move again
All right, here  is folks  This book is OK  's completely predictable  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy great adventure   could be the simplest story  pulpous as all hell, but I'd still champion    was written well  with some real heart, not with the movie  mindbr So, I  touch on the problem with all of Crichton's books; he has the script   mind while writing  Great, go for   But don't put  on a bookshelf,  leave  on your agent's desk   you want entertaining time travel see  Connie Willis(To Say Nothing of the Dog)  her homage to Jerome K  Jerome(I didn't know who he was either)   br PS  From viewing the  &quot;Also Bought&quot; list  You people need to get off the bestseller  list, 's all fodder  Check out who Crichton reads,  respects,  I'm  sure you will run into Phillip K Dick  Harlan Ellison(two far superior  writers) They are more than likely  the genre( there is such a thing)  you like  Hell, Dick's stories were the basis for Blade Runner, Total  Recall,  Screamers  All of those flicks bury those giant lizards  somewhere along the Congo, marked by a giant Sphere
I LOVED this book!   reminded me so much of the fantasies that I used to read when I was a little girl transported me  My usual reading material is police stories  serial killers, so this book was a refreshing change  Maybe  isn't Crichton's best work, but I became very involved  with the characters - always a sign that I am enjoying myself!
Entertainment  That's what I read books for  I'm not looking to learn indepth scientific theory  discuss the literary merits of the novel as though  were a literary classic akin to that of Victor Hugo, Thomas Hardy  Jane Austen  That's what college was for   these are the things you  are looking for  this book, then you are probably going to be  disappointed   you are looking for an entertaining read, then you  probably won't
 you liked Jurassic Park  Sphere, that is no guarantee you will like Timeline The scientific jargon ends early on,  a good 34 of the book is simply the main characters running around 14th century France, luckily jumping from one adventure to the next A bit contrived,  you ask me The  dialogue is not convincing,  neither are the characters  plot The  setting, however, is excellent
I must admit that I am often  awe of Crichton's intensive research  knowledge of the subjects of which he writes   this story, however, his amazing sense of detail as  pertains to the physics, archeology  history are overshadowed by the lurking sense that this was intended to be  a film  Has he gotten so used to his books becoming movies that he is now  editing the book for a script while he is writing the novel?  I hope not,  but I think so        you are interested  another smart  well  researched novel that makes you want to learn more about a subject you  never thought you would before, buy this book!
The book gives occasional glimpses of Crichton's considerable story-telling skills, but disappoints  the hopelessly one-dimensional characters  the preposterous gimmicks (radio transmitter ear plugs that work  don't work, depending on Crichton's plot requirements) needed to  make the plot hang together Obviously written to meet obligations to a  publisher The only solace will be for aspiring writers, to see that even a  pro can make a mess of things
's been done beforetime travelbut probably not quite so entertainingly You can idle through the explanation as to how this is accomplished, because I'm not sure that the author quite got , but 's  of no moment They can travelcoming back  the same exact form as you  left seems to be a problem, however That is a fact that is kept from our  intrepid adventurers, but not from the reader This story really moves   is full of interesting  apparently accurate information when  takes us  back to the 1350's To read about those days from MrCrichton's viewpoint  makes one glad to have been born  the 20th century The story of what is  happening back at the laboratory is not quite so compelling, but the book  certainly holds the readers interest while telling a darn good yarn I  would give this 4  a half stars,  half stars were available You won't  regret having bought 
I've read all of Crichton's novels,  have had a fine time doing  Timeline is beautifully researched, a good plot,   reads like a movie I can't say exactly what that means, but by the end  seemed to overwhelm  the story  no longer seemed to be written as a book, on 's own, but as  a treatment, to be filmed For all of its excitement,  demanded very  little exercise of the imagination,  was just plain not as much fun to  read
Timeline is the first Michael Crighton novel that I have read   was the cover that caught my attention, being a history buff  I found the book to be an easy, fun read but from the start saw a movie script written    Let's face , Crighton is big  the media, so  he writes with a film   mind, what else should we expect?  However,  was a smart, entertaining  book  I read   2 evenings  Something I haven't done  ages  Less  than halfway through the book I was trying to figure out who would be the  right actor for each part,  I agree with a previous reviewerMarek  would be difficult to cast   you want a quick, fun, exciting read, check  out this bookSure,  will be a movie, but now I have more to look  forward to!
I have to admit, after reading this book I actually did do alittle bit of reading up on quantum physics  differentdimensionalities, etc  I'm still pretty boggled by the whole thing Anyway, I found the book to be very enjoyable  Not quite the usual Crichton (thus the 4 stars instead of 5), but supsenseful  amusing nonetheless  I got the book for Christmas  read  before classes resumed  I didn't find  the least bit &quot;boring&quot;  &quot;tiring&quot;  &quot;contrived&quot;  I also found the change of pace from the usual Crichton dinos  corporate fare of late to medieval France intriguing  I would definitely recommend  to fiction lovers, old Crichton fans  new initiates alike  END
I've read quite a few of Michael Crichton's books I'm also quite a fan of the time travel genre I naturally assumed this would be a fantastic combination, however I was somewhat disappointed with &quot;Timeline&quot;   Although  was an enjoyable read,  seemed way off Crichton's usual  writing style,  I had a hard time associating Crichton with actually  having written this novel  's good for checking out of the library, but  I wouldn't add  to my personal collection  I agree with a earlier  reviewer who said  seemed like  was written with movie motives
Timeline was fastpaced  fun to the end, but I enjoyed the setting more than anything else  I've always had an affection for the Medieval times,  with Timeline the reader is presented with many interesting facts about  this time period without the hindering tedium of a history book  By far  the best of Crichton settings
What a great read this was The first 100  so pages lost me  the world of quantum computers, but once I suspended my hold on reality,  checked into the wonderful world of fantasy  imagination, I was enthralled  Better than Jurasic Park  my opinion,  I hope for a sequel of some  kind, I couldn't put this book down Shame on anyone that found this book  to be boring  predictable- was exciting,  interesting, as well as  educational  fun I hated for  to be over My &quot;I don't read  fiction husband&quot; even found  to hold his attention A perfect read  for the lover of fiction  twists You never knew what the future,  the  past held for the characters You found yourself  love  hate with each  one,  wondering who the &quot;bad guy&quot; was Way to go Mr Crighton-  do  again  thank you for this one
oksome may find this boringbut to tell you the truth, I didnt I  read the thing  less than a week  however, i am a kid  i think kids  are more likely to be interested  the chasefight sequences than an adult  would beitz also very easy to follow
I bought this book with the sole purpose of being entertained lightly,   that is exactly what  achieved Had I wanted a more extensive review of  quantum physics  time travel I would have probably bought a different  book, which is what I would recommend to other people looking to getting  more of an education  The plot is interesting enough, however just toward  the end  gets a bit tiring, I admit But again, for light reading   entertaining  was exactly right Also, I thought very highly of AIRFRAME
Having been a fan, I ignored the unfavorable reviews  bought the book - only to discover that this story read like a made for TV script  I constantly tried to suspend disbelief to get through - not possible for me   I kept thinking that some high school kid wrote this story - went back   time - substituted  at the last nanosecond with Mr Crichton's publisher  oh well,   enough time wasted  One point nine thumbs down!
There is no better book to read on vacation  So much research went into the description of every phase of this book, that sometimes I wonder  I didn't really visit that castle  France  The book is absorbing, exciting   engaging  I give  four stars instead of five because  read a  little too much like a screenplay  's one thing to be transported to  another one of the &quot;multiple universes,&quot; but the added comic  relief at tense moments just as you would find  a movie were unnecessary   insulting, as  I needed  to keep me interested  finishing the  book  Nevertheless, great story line  compelling characters
This is my first Crichton book I have read  The story is interesting  he doesn't bore you with scientific jargon throughout the book, just the absolute basics to convince the reader that  may be feasible to travel  between universes  The plot is somewhat predictable but the action will  keep you turning the page  I can't wait for the movie!
The use of Quantum Multiverses to travel back  time has been widely used  Sci-fi literature for decades I cannot see the originality of this story, because  contains the usual time-travel paradoxes  similar topics  as other readers have noted,  turns out to be just another adventures book once the time travel is made The diagrams are classical  Chichton books  very explanatory, that's true Year-lights away  quality  imagination from Andromeda Strain's, his best novel ever For a very good novel on multiverses, better read 'What A Mad Universe', by Fredric Brown
Timeline is Michael Crichton's best work since Disclosure, which isn't really saying much since the two novels that have been published between these two books, Lost World  Airframe were absolutely atrociousbr I was  interested  the first 150 pages when the concept of quantum physics was  discussed  put into action, but after the three main characters made   to 1357,  became nothing more than the Lost World without the dinosaurs,  with nothing more than small dialog between chase scenesbr I suspect my  lack of enthusiasm with the book also has something to do with my lack of  interest  medieval times  I was left to wonder  Crichton was able to  weave a story that involved the US Civil War  the American Revolutionary  War  I would feel different about   We'll probably never knowbr I  agree that this has the making of a great movie, but unfortunately, that is  how Crichton writes these days, with the movie  mind first, then the  story itselfbr Overall, 's just an OK book
Although I'm not a huge fan, the book's jacket was interesting enough to catch my attention so I purchased  expecting something like Jurassic Park   wasn't even close; however,  was an easy read, very little  depth of characterization, predictable  clearly written with a  screenplay  mind ( might just make a decent movie, but I don't know who  they would get to play Andre)  This could have been so much more    I  was disappointed that  wasn't!
- Evil corporation invents a time machine to be used for no good - Sends professor back  time to the middle ages - History students go back to save him - Hoorah!
 Timeline, you are wisked away to a world where there is not limit on blood  gore, where time machines are the latest  cutting technology,  where three Yale graduate students go back to the middle ages to save  their professer This book entertained me while teaching me a lot of  interesting facts about Science  history This book was written  beautifully Anyone who gets bored with this book obviously does not have a  cultured taste
Not much of a history-buff myself, I did not appreciate (YET) the description of the CastelguardLa Roque ruins at the start of the story  Then I found the quantum explanation highly &quot;technical&quot; when  GordonKramer discussed this to the students; but I guess that was  necessary to give non-physics readers the a clear description of the  story's main foundation --- &quot;QUANTUM LEAP&quot;  From there,  took  on a much faster pace where our protagonists were adversely faced with  their 14th century opponents --- full of action &amp; heartstopping events    Overall, 's an enjoyable read for adventure seekers  True, 's like  Jurrassic Park, with a historical theme park background, but I say the  readers will not feel bored basically because of this characteristic This  story will certainly be a high-budgetted, entertaining movie to watch for   the future
I don't know  anybody has understood the ten page explanation about quantum physics I guess 's time travelling (again)  that`s all    The problem with the book is that just when  should become thrilling  (arrival at 1357),  develops into a nothing-more-than-an-adventure-novel     Just  case nobody has claimed: Crichton writes thinking of the movie:  any candidate for Chris  Kate characters?  Ah! Don't get lost   multiverse, he, he
As usual, you can tell that Crichton put a lot of research into this book The level of detail that he describes of daily living, from the food eaten to the clothes worn, is really fantastic Coupled with a clever storyline,   was a quick  interesting read
I picked up this book thinking  was going to take a long time to read, but I couldn't put  down The beginning was kind of slow I found myself wondering when they were actually going to time travel, but the wait was  well worth  An interesting  realistic theory on time travel  now I  actually know a little bit about quantum physics! Once the characters   this book step into 14th century France, this book is action-packed   provides information about that age  has a cool ending, but  seemed  Crichton rushed the last few chapters up to the Epilogue The ending is  even open to a sequel which I am hoping for
Michael Crichton has written better books  TIMELINE, he just tries too hard to write a fast-moving, suspenseful novel  because of that, the plot-mechanics become too visible There are chapter-headlines which  resemble a countdown  many,  fact too many action scenes  the  feeling, like many other readers pointed out already, that this book was  too much written with a movie  mind Yes, the book starts quite well, but  quickly turns into a series of action set-pieces which become more  more  boring There are some fascinating descriptions about the middle-ages Dear  Mr Crichton, why haven't you focused on them? Yes, I know, you need to  sell a lot of copies, but believe me, the book would have been much more  thrilling  Crichton's body of work this book most closely resembles  &quot;The Lost World&quot; (another bore with a lot of action)  is miles  away from his better works like the recent, much more thrilling  &quot;Airframe&quot;, which nearly had no action but much more page-turning  suspense
Although the book has a lot of action  goes nowhere Crichton has strayed from the great believable story telling  Andromeda Strain Jurassic Park  seems he now writes ridiculous stories that are meant to  go directly to film Wait for the movie on this one
This book was great   had action, drama, suspense,  a little bit of history  I for one thought that &quot;Timeline&quot; was one of Crichton's best ('s as good as &quot;Jurrasic Park&quot;)   you love action   blood then you'll love this book   takes  about 100 pages to get  interesting, but once you get to a certain point, you can't put  down   The only downside to this book was that the ending was rushed
Timeline starts off rather slow giving the reader information on the corporate aspects of ITC, the leading-edge corporation developing new techniques  the controversial field of quantum physics  The unusual actions  mysterious death of an ITC employee captures the reader's  attention  quickly draws them into the bookbr The pace of the book  remains relatively slow until a group of archeologists  historians,  funded by ITC, are sent back 1357 to the site that they are studying  From  that point on  is a non-stop ride  a most accurate portrayal of the  14th century  Crichton draws you into the time  keeps you  readingbr The book is typical Crichton,  is a well researched high-tech  page turner  The lack of depth  the characters  their predictability  was kind of a turn off, but the fast paced intriguing plot kept me reading    also lacked a good sub-plot  Although the book continues to refer to  the &quot;present&quot; time where they try to repair equipment at ITC is a  sufficient sub-plot, I think  would have been much more interesting to  have a more detailed sub-plot involving characters  the 14th  centurybr All together  was an excellent read  I would recommend   to any Crichton fan as well as any reader interested  the medieval times,  chivalry  high-tech books
This book is great  Its violent,  swears, its like a movie, hey, its what Americans want!  Although the first 50 pages are a bore, br after that the plot becomes intense  you have any sense,  you'll read this  book, take a look at the contents of this story,  can be quite  goreybr The book's a lot of fun, enjoy  while reading  the sun, but  you'll like the pace of this action packed racebr ! READ THIS BOOK! READ  THIS BOOK! READ THIS BOOK! READ THIS BOOK! READ THIS BOOK! READ  THIS BOOK! READ THIS BOOK! READ THIS BOOK! READ THIS BOOK! READ  THIS BOOK! READ THIS BOOK! READ THIS BOOK! READ THIS BOOK! READ  THIS BOOK! READ THIS BOOK! READ THIS BOOK! READ THIS BOOK!
I thought this book was excellent  weaved science, adventure, suspense,  action together like only Chrichton canI can definitely see this book becoming a movie as well I can literally see exactly what each scene from  the movie will look like as I read the bookbr My only hope is that the  science behind the book isn't lost like  so many other Chrichton based  movies
Easy to read, fast moving, lots of blood, violence  action but not much  the way of an intelligent, thought provoking plot as is more typical of the author  is simply one chase after another with the heros escaping  sure death again  again  again  again by the narrowest  of margins until you you want to throw the book at someone Much more  suitable as a script for a teenage action movie  is not a book you will  likely see on your local library's book discussion list
Sure, I enjoyed this book but  the end I felt I was reading a movie script  Rather than character  story depth, the book ended with a lot of pointless running around - I could see the camera shots   pyrotechniques  my head  Started off with intriguing science   potential character development  ended like a cynical action movie  pitch
&quot;The first 13 of the book was mesmerizing, but the last 13 was very poorly written&quot; Where's the other third?  Maybe you should have said &quot;12&quot;
This book started out great but started to become predictable by the middle  A very quick read
This book was so great, possibly the best book I had ever readuntil the end The ending was very disappointing
I loved the 'science'  commentary on the future, but the story of running around 1357 that fills the last two-thirds of the book got really long with no real point  This must have been written with a movie deal   mind  This book read like a Hollywood thriller
Very interesting novel  Once started, finished  less than 24 hours Even during breathing sessions, parts came to mind  Worth ordering
Timeline is a superb read Taking you from a modern day period back to the days of knights  jousting matches is totally wonderful Crichton really put a lot of time into researching this topic as you will be able to see by  the  depth knowledge used  the book  also contains humor  romance  along with the technical, making Timeline the cream of the crop of  Crichton's novels
The first 13 of the book was mesmerizing but the last 13 was very poorly written This is an ambitious topic (one worth exploring) but the ending really is ridiculous Was he late for an appointment when he finished the  book? Could have been huge!
This book was amazing  I have never been able to complete a book about medival times  a sci-fi book, so this was quite new for me  Like a good book, i was unable to put  down
As an avid fan of Crichton since my _Jurassic Park_ childhood, I found myself with mixed feelings regarding _Timeline_ While an extremely well-thought out book, deeply immersed  academics  atmosphere,  was  rather lacking  what I look for most  a novel: character  developmentbr As far as Quantum Theory is concerned, the work is top-notch  --QT for the average Joe, so to speak, with enough research done to give  Quantum Physics students, such as myself, something to dig into  Apparently, many of the reviewers that complain about the  &quot;paradox&quot; regarding the Professor's  Marek's influence on La  Roque  Castelgard did not even read --much less understand-- the concept  of the multiverse There is no paradox; the multiverse, a theory that is  very real, explains  perfectly Also, the idea of the quantum  &quot;foam&quot; (which is referred to  my classes as a sort of  &quot;meshgrid&quot;) functions as the safety net for the  &quot;time-travel&quot; necessary for the plot To summarize, the  time-hopping  altering of events is brilliantly planned outbr As for  the medieval setting, I cannot give a cultured opinion, being more  interested  pre-Christianity eras However, the atmosphere drawn by  _Timeline_ felt intense, rich with description  attention to detail  Moreover, the cultural  social environment was thoroughly believable,  though I'm quite sure a professional historian would insist on there being  mistakes   Nevertheless, I doubt even such a historian would be  distracted from the actual plot by minor mistakesbr However, despite the  intensity of the intellectual nourishment given by both the Multiverse  Theory  the depiction of medieval times, there is one major flaw  this  book: its characters True, there are memorable instances such as Chris   Kate, but for the most part the cast remained as a flock of faceless  minions --the villains being the worst offenders Sir Guy struck me as themost cliched of all, with little goals  motivations that could earn him  sympathy  empathy Doniger's origins had serious potential as well, but  alas, he soon became the Evil Overlord (tm) of all that he sees , as is  Crichton's wont, the introduction of &quot;prologue-only&quot; characters  such as the rug-hunting couple  the hospital staff detracts slightly  from the overall view of the cast; thankfully, this is only another  instance of Crichton's method of introduction, the likes of which are even  more evident  _Jurassic Park_  _The Andromeda Strain_ Similarly,  entities such as the crazed knight of the Green Chapel act more like plot  devices than fully-fleshed characters, but even they serve to develop ones  like Chris'  Kate'sbr However, despite the drawbacks regarding the  growth of the characters, I found _Timeline_ quite enjoyable,  not as  riveting  haunting as _Jurassic Park_,  as complex as _Rising Sun_  What _Timeline_ misses  tridimensional personalities,  makes up dearly   plot development, context  backstory My only serious gripe is that  the ending is rather sudden,  its hollow feeling lingers slightly after  the book is read, but as one quote goes:br &quot;The journey itself is more  important than the destination&quot;br ,  _Timeline_, this adage  comes true  no small way
Michael Crichton has relied once again on the tried  true formula he used  Jurassic Park, only this time he's taken modern people back  time (sort of) instead of bringing ancient creatures forward, supporting his  idea with scientific theory  The concept is wonderful, but the author  fails somewhat  his execution  As I read this book, I kept hungering for  more details of life  the fourteenth century, more character development,  more of everything (except for the swordfighting, which quickly got  boring)  br His layman's description of quantum mechanics was quite  interesting, as were his descriptions of chaos theory  _Jurassic Park_,  even though, for obvious reasons, somewhat simplistic  However,  felt as   as  he had take the T Rexriver chase scene  JP  expanded  to  book length, neglecting the careful descriptions of characters   surroundings that made _Jurassic Park_ such an enjoyable read  I hope this  trend  his writing does not continue  _Timeline_ would not have suffered    had been expanded to twice its lengthbr However, kudos to Mr  Crichton for the inclusion of the &quot;Chapel Perilous&quot;,  of  course the &quot;Green Knight&quot;!
Micheal Crichton has great ideas with fairly well researched science behind them BUT he just cannot write well! The beginning of the book is very informative  has a scientific compelling twist then there  comes the 'fill': a long tale -pages  pages- of video game like fast  paced medieval fihgts, where the 'actors' get wounded, recover on the next  page then almost die instantly get a new life to run around to another  battle : Michael, do you ever read again what you just typed on the page   do you rest on the laurels gained  your much better early books while  watching the royalties flow ?
I really enjoyed this page turning book Mr Crichton has found an excellent formula that combines a technology with a fictional story   this case quantum mechanics  history take center stage to form a  masterfully narrated fabled plot  This book rates equal to  higher than  Airframe  Disclosure  you like classic Crichton you will enjoy this  one
I've been an avid Crichton fan since picking up The Andromeda Strain as a young teen  I still love Congo--probably my favorite overall  I approached this book with high expectations  The premise intrigued me,   I enjoy medieval settings  Unfortunately, after a great build-up, I found  myself  a two-dimensional 14th century, with cardboard villians   annoying scene-breaks (used to move along the story, I suppose)  Time  seemed to grind by as I read to the end   came as no surprise that some  early subplots never matured  For example, what happened to Sophie?  Why  was she even introduced  her scenes with Chris early on?  I'd pass this  book on, but with only a half-hearted recommendation   the old days,  Crichton would've taken the time to make this book gallop  Instead,   came trotting to the finish line, taking first-place by using the shortcuts  allowed only by previous success
I REALLY liked the beginning part of the book  once  got into Crighton's theories of &quot;Time Travel&quot; I was thrilled at the realistic level of detail  accuracy that makes me wonder  this  technology is at all possible!br I thought that the mid-evil scenes were  okay I was hoping for more Time theories  less old-type action  A  major problem was (I tend to skim,  read quickly so I need a book that  constantly reminds me who characters are  whats going on) that i got  lost a bunch of times  didn't know what was going on&lt;sigh&gt;,  very frustrating  I enjoyed the other Crighton book, Sphere much  betterbr I WILL tell you this, though  I really admire all of his work   a glance at the sources cited page will show much research he puts into  his books  I believed( still do) all of his historical references   thought  was a nice touch br Good, but not great  Worth reading  you  like historical stuffI'm more of a sci-fi fan myself
I've read a lot of Michael Crichton's books  I think that this is definatly the best yet   kept me glued to the book  My only gripe about  is that the end could have been pulled off a little better   was a  little mean  Other then that,  was an excellent book which I would  reccommend to anyone with no reservation
I usually don't devour a book of this size  three days With this one, I did  you have enjoyed his &quot;Sphere&quot;  &quot;Congo&quot;, you will like this one The middle parts of the book is a bit stuffy but the  thrill speeds up towards the alst third of the book This is the second  time I witness MC's interest is &quot;Authenticity&quot; Try to rent his  1970s classic &quot;Westworld&quot;  compare The way quantum physics is  portrait is fun with the exclusion of the occasional $50 terms like:  Orthogonal Multiverse Coordinate Change! You'll have fun finding this one  out I am glad to see the MC has still the gift to move us from into the  realm of adventure fanstasy
I got this book on tape   was so good I found myself setting  the car listening to   This book is really a must have
At first I was a little disappointed with the technology that Crichton was using  this story The idea of not actually traveling back  time but going to an alternate location wasn't what I expected the book to be about  After a while  reading further on,  all sort of grew on me  became  more interesting The concept being many  evolving universes beside each  other;  multiverses  The story became exciting when the team was sent to  14th century France to save a colleague Crichton uses a vast knowledge  acquired of these dark ages to enhance  describe the happenings  this  era Crichton seems to have a knack for hi-tech sci-fi thrillers such as  &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;  &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;  &quot;Timeline&quot; is right up there with the best of them This was a  fun book to read
Quantum mechanics is a subject that fascinates me   is obvious that Crichton did his homework  I enjoyed the scientific side of the book the most  Once its characters were back  history,  became a historical  romance novel I don't think  is up to Jurassic Park, but  is close   is definitely worth the price of the book
Timeline is a book based on a group of archeologists studying the Middle Ages  They find themselves  a high-tech lab  New Mexico where the company tells them that Andre Marek, Chris  Kate must travel back to 14th century France  rescue thier Professor  They encounter many  hardships,  they lead you into a world without mercybr I thought this  book was on of the best ever made!  was extraordinarily great  a good  read for anyone   is very realistic, like all of the people  1362  speak Occitan,  you get to glimpse that language   is also great for  anyone to read because  ties  science, romance, action, etc with the  Middle Ages  Some of the book is about how a company puts together a  &quot;universe travel&quot; machine   all I think that this is a great  book that I would reccommend strongly for anyone to read  Good job,  Chrichton
Oh wow  I really love this book  Crichton does  again  I love all of Michael Crichton's books  this one takes the cake   you like Crichton, you will have fun with this one for sure
I have read many of Michael Crichton's books  I feel he has topped his best with TIMELINE  The story has been written with such perfection so that  flows like a rollar coaster, just when one feels the action is getting wilder,  exploads with details  even with the words on the  page, I was able to see every second of the joust WAY TO GO MICHAEL !   ( sorry Egghead closed)
I've read many of Michael Crichton's novels,  I generally like his work  but this book wasn't particularly satisfying  was absorbing enough, even a little exciting at times,  obviously Crichton did his homework on  12th century France  But this book reads too much like a tie- to a  movie that hasn't even been made ( God knows 's just a matter of time  before the movie IS made) Most of the various conundrums the characters  find themselves  are resolved entirely too quickly  neatly Crichton  is quite up-front  admitting that the notion of time-travel remains   the realm of fantasy, but even he could have explored the paradoxes  involved a little more convincingly  books were meals, this one would  taste okay but certainly wouldn't be very filling
Although the plot was interesting (even though  was merely a Jurasic Park), the writing, character development, etc was lacking considerably Why, oh why, couldn't Crichton have populated the story with three  dimensional characters that one could enjoy following? All of the  characters could easily have been replaced by Good Guy 1, Good Guy 2, Bad  Guy 1,  Bad Guy 2,  NO harm would have come to the story--that's how  underdeveloped they were! As for the writing, there are ways to begin  dialogue other than to type He said, &quot;&quot;     what about  atmosphere, tangible descriptions, etc?  short, the book had a good  concept but unfortunatey seemed to have been written merely as the  forethought to a script
Timeline may very well be Michael Crichton's best novel since Jurassic Park Michael Crichton has plausibly blended modern technology with history The story involves a team of scientists sent back  time to a  parallel universe They must learn how to survive  Middle-Ages France   return to the year 1999 before  is to late,  be trapped  the  fourteenth century forever
 you have read Crichton before, then you should need no further encouragment to read this novel-  is excellent  Timeline takes Crichton out of his post Jurassic Park slump with flying colors!  The mix of Science   Imagination are just about perfect  As a Historian myself,  is nice  to see this profession the subject of a Crichton adventure at last  The  Physics of time travel are also new (at least to me)  very wild  His  bibliography is quite extensive,  assuming that there is some truth to  the concepts then our world is indeed a more confusing place than I  originally thought  Something about multiple universes is just disturbing-  I don't think I can be tricked into believing  as easily as I was with  the cloning of Dinosaurs  Still- action  adventure  a fast paced  read?  This novel has  all
The book put me there! Period! Whether  be the techno offices of ITC  the veridian green countrysides of mediaeval europe I was there, I was educated,  I wanted to climb into the book  go back  time just for  the 37 hours that the protagonists were   a sense I did! br The  protagonists were pushed to their physical  mental limits  the  illustration of this therein painted how rough a time  was to survive   I loved the politics, the battles, the history of  all The individuals  that did best were the ones who were both strong of heart, mind  body   that was how our protagonists were createdbr The writer clearly paints  how brutal  is to kill a man with a sharp weapon  can get pretty gross  but  my opinion  should be articulated that way so you can appreciate  the evil,  courage  you will, when going into battle  forced to face  such a horrible task
 was a great book  was extremely suspenseful  kept me reading the whole night I just couldn't put the book down Imagine: I read this 449 page book  two days Non-stop! Read  Read  READ !
Despite a couple logic errors  the storyline (which I can't tell, because that would reveal some of the plot), Crichton's latest book is a runaway hit!  There wasn't a moment where there wasn't something exciting  happening!   From the bloody battles to the thrilling chase scenes,  Crichton fans will not be disappointed  this new action-packed thriller!   A must for all Crichton  medieval novel fans!
I think this is one of Crichtons best books  The book put me there! Period! Whether  be the technologic offices  the green forests  a counrty side of mediaeval europe I was actually there, I was fully  educated,  I wanted to be a part of the book  go back  time just  for the time that the protaginosts were   a sense I really felt like  br The protagonists were pushed to their physical  mental limits   the illustration of this therein painted how rough a time  was to survive   I loved the politics, the battles, the history of  all The  individuals that did best were the ones who were both strong of heart, mind   body  that was how our protagonists were createdbr The writer  clearly paints how brutal  is to kill a man with a sharp weapon  can  get pretty gruesom  my opinoin   should be told  a way so you can  appreciate the evil,  courage, when going into a battle  being force  to face a horrible task such as killing someone
Once again, Michael Crichton has successfully created a world where the latest scientific theories are exposed to the realities of their use This time, however, the story he creates is gripping throughout, with a plot  that holds the reader to the last pagebr The success of the novel is based  upon a well-researched understanding of quantum mechanics  conjunction  with a well-researched historical analysis of a period (14th Century)   location (France) The physics is plausible, considering the latest  discoveries  quantum mechanics,  the historical elements are clearly  built from extensive study (just see the bibliography)br But this package  of history  science is put together with a rollercoaster narrative where  the reader finds themselves laughing at one moment,  biting their nails  at the next My only criticism is that the depth of the bad guy's character  could have been developed furtherbr  has been some time since a novel  has commanded my attention so fully,  I have already recommended the  book to several friends who have been equally enthusiastic
Mr Crichton is one of my very favorite authors  so i will forgive him this one Initially i thought i was digging into yet another of his brilliant visions, but alas,  was not to be Perhaps he was distracted  Even the scientific premise was fatally flawed Messages planted  a  parallel universe would show up only  THAT future, not ours Ah well, no  one's perfect  at least now i have an idea of what quantum theory is  about
Timeline keeps your interest but doesn't go the extra distance to make  an exceptional book One is fascinated with time travel  the implications of going into the past You get this with the development of a  time travel machine from a powerful  devious scientist However, after  being set up we want to get into the details which are mundane There is no  real development of characters  subplots, such as a love story  mano a  mano showdown between good  evil Yes there is some fighting  some  allusion to romance but  is rather light For instance, this period of  the early 1300s saw the superiority of the longbow versus the crossbow  (Battle of Crecy)  battle Also, the Arabs developed  1304 the first  arrow shooting device by gunpowderThat would have been a good concept to  exploit We get no flavor of this but get the usual joust story  the book  which is OK but lame Love story? Forget  No one really cares about the  characterswho loves, dies, lives At the end, there is a hint but for a  book this should have been fleshed out Still, the concept is good   there are some curve balls to keep you guessing There are also allusions  that this period of the early 1300s were not the dark ages that we were  taught We get a flavor but not enough substance other than being told that  the fabrics had nice colors A TV movie is about the speed of this book  versus earthbreaking grounds like the book, Coma Buy the paperback for the  long flight as  more than satisfies &quot;chewing gum for the eyes   brain&quot;
I found Timeline to be a very stupid book  I wanted to read  to learn more about theory of time travel using quantum physics  easy-to-read  entertaining language  However, the whole time travel aspect is just  glossed over  Time travel is simply the means of justify putting the  characters  a time  place where, presumably, every other person got  their head lobbed off  The book started out with a promise of being a  sleek science fiction thriller but by the time I was halfway through  I  realized  was just boring, violent tripe  The characters are dull, Dull,  DULL!   Plots  characters appear  then never develop  There's no  suspense at all because whatever terrible obstacles arise the protagonists  always just overcome them without seemingly much effort  Unfortunately I'm  one of those that just HAS to finish a book once they've started so I  actually wasted my time reading all 400+ pages  (Although I have to admit  by the end I was just skimming)  The only thing that kept me going were  the few (very few) interesting details about how life differed  the 13th  century  (Although I really question how well researched  accurate the  presentation of life back then was)   they make this into a movie like  they do EVERY Michael Crichton book I will avoid  at ALL COSTS!    However, this might make a good bathroom book because surely  is a good  substitute for bran muffins  You can just tear out the pages as you read   need them
One of the few books of fiction that both my husband  I read  we both liked  No boring sections either  There is always something happening   keeps you wanting to turn the page  The characters could  have used a little more development  parts were rather predictable but I  didn't even care  Enjoyable read!
I am sorry - I tried reading this one but found  was awful!   Storyline started off great but by the middle of the book I had had enough!  Very disappointing cause I think Michael Crichton could have done so much  better!
An intriguing combination of science fiction  a medeival adventure, TIMELINE reads like the fusion of a screen play  a novel  Many novels lose a bit  translation to the screen Crichton appears to finesse that  problem by merging screenplay  novel A potentially great story gets  watered down  the process  br While the 20th century megalomaniac CEO is  a bit shallow, the quantum physics discussions make enough sense to allow  suspension of disbelief  Later revelations that characters do not  &quot;time travel,&quot; but instead regenerate  alternate universes,  conflict with a critical plot element placing 20th century artifacts at the  &quot;dig&quot;  France  This paradox is never addressed  br The action  is descriptive enough,  only one of the many combat scenes depicts a  20th century medeivalist  a Holywoodesque fight against multiple  opponents  Tough to suspend disbelief on that one  br A sincere effort is  made to overcome the 14th century vs 20th century language problem by  providing quantum computer driven translators to medeival scholars  specializing  a particular region of 14th century France  Regrettably,  the language barrier isn't sustained throughout the 37 hours that the  mission is alloted, though the early confusion experienced by some  characters is well described  Picking up  conversing  a language you  have studied  books  on tapes takes more than a few hours  Try  studying Italian; then converse with a man who only speaks Neapolitan  dialect   is confusing br On the bright side, Crichton provides some  intriguing alternatives to commonly accepted medeival anachronisms, gives a  great description of old growth forests,  has an eye for action  Unlike  some reviewers, I did not find the beheading of a character to be  gratuitous violence,  found the joust scene to be credible enough to  fit  He does a shallow exposition of medeival intrigue,  gives Chivalry  a nudge  twoin the ribsbr Overall, the story could eliminate some plot  digressions: for example, what story value did the crazy green knight add?    Chris falling out of the boat?  Why not develop Kate  Chris'  realtionship more fully throughout the story?   br TIMELINE is good for  reading on an airplane flight, but below the standard Crichton set with  ANDRIMEDA STRAIN  Hope the film deal works out,  could be a lot of fun
The book put me there!  Period!  Whether  be the techno offices of ITC  the veridian green countrysides of mediaeval europe I was there, I was educated,  I wanted to climb into the book  go back  time just for  the 37 hours that the protagonists were   a sense I did!br I was  entertained,  actually inspired The heavy, named Doniger, is a cross  between Bill Gates  Steve Jobs  Donniger's seductive style when  speaking  front of an audience,  his crass insults directed at  underlings were a clear cut morph between Jobs  Gates,   my  opinion,  was done perfectly  Donniger's speech towards the end of the  book may have been honest  ugly but  too gave me insight as to how our  culture has changed from then to now (We are such wimps  the 21st  century) br The protagonists were pushed to their  physical  mental  limits  the illustration of this therein painted how rough a time  was  to survive  I loved the politics, the battles, the history of  all   The individuals that did best were the ones who were both strong of heart,  mind  body  that was how our protagonists were createdbr The writer  clearly paints how brutal  is to kill a man with a sharp weapon   can  get pretty gross but  my opinion  should be articulated that way so you  can appreciate the evil,  courage  you will, when going into battle   forced to face such a horrible taskbr The manners of speech  politics  of the time enthralled me  I want more  Both sexes are fairly protrayed  with no sexism  bias  (Lady Claire  Andre' Marek were my favorite  characters  personally speaking I feel they were the alpha female   alpha male of the book  I really  truly reccomend this book  I  wouldn't of written such a pedantic review This was also my first Crichton  book
This is one of those novels that changes directions several times just to throw you off a little  I enjoyed the physics element  the beginning  the adventure of the rest of the book  was quite fast paced  I could see  as a movie but the book was quite descriptive of the characters   battles  Good fun!
Michael Crichton's Timeline is well written  my opiniion Timeline is one of the best Science fiction book's that has been written   had suspense,  drama which made Timeline a well written book The plot about time travel kept Timeline from being anything but boring The character  interaction seemed real All the details added suspense  made Timeline  an even better story  The characters Gomez, Chris, the doctor, the  professor,  the others all fit into the story perfectly I have also  read Michael Crichton's Airframe, The Lost World, Sphere, Eaters of the  Dead, Jurassic Park, Congo, The Andromeda strain  These books also have a  great plot  character interaction  I would recommend these book to  those who like fiction books  great literature
Being an enormous fan of Crichton's work, I could not possibly help but buy this book the month  came out Jurassic Park is still my favorite novel to this day,  I own a copy of all Crichton's fiction except Eaters  of the Dead (which was good, but too dry for my taste)br The thing I like  most about his books is that he teaches us things  Incidentally,  everything he writes about is stuff I really enjoy: pathology, genetics,  xenobiology, quantum mechanics, role-reversal on controversial aspects of  law  ethics   addition, his characters are always diverse   colorful  They might be shady  bright  nature, but they're always  colorfulbr The fact that I've never had any interest  medieval France  didn't help any, but there was something else missing  Perhaps  was the  lack of dynamic personalities like those he created  Disclosure   Airframe, the way he put the story into the hands of his characters instead  of the narrator   maybe  was the fact that two cool people were killed  right off the batbr Whatever  was, Timeline is a book I probably won't  be reading again, not for a long time  I recommend  to anyone who has a  taste for your basic dramaactionadventure  But for a true Crichton fan  like myself, maybe you should wait until his next one
Our neighborhood book club chose this as its March selection  rated  at 3 to 35  We too observed that  appeared to have been written as the precurser to a screenplay  Members of the group commented that the chase  episodes became old after about the first two -- a plot device perhaps  overused  Others likened the plot to &quot;Time  Again&quot; by Jack  Finney; the project leader's name  that book was Danziger   a  character made  a choice similar to one  Crichton's book  We found the  science interesting to contemplate, but not being physicists cannot comment  on its accuracy  Definitely was an interesting look into the Middle Ages
&quot;~The best novel I've read since The Triumph &amp; the Glory   terms of chilling excitement, on-the-edge-of-your-seat suspense,  scene after scene of powerful confrontation, Timeline has few rivals  I thought  the concept was fascinating but had my doubts that Crichton could pull   off, but he did  The story was credible enough for the mass fiction  market   wasn't perfect, but what is ?  OK, the JK Rowling books are   you ask a twelve-year-old, but other than them ? Crichton has a good one  here
I have been a longtime fan of Michael Crichton  I count Jurassic Park, Congo, Airframe, Sphere,  The Andromeda Strain, are among my favorites  I have found that this book, like The Lost World, seem to be written as   they were rough screenplays rather than novels  Both books contain classic  Crichton-esque close-to-reality science fiction, but both lack  what made  his earlier books so wonderful  Crichton expends only one page per major  character  character development!  Once the story begins, all  derscriptions of characters  settings disappear   is so bad that  Crichton has to resort to using PICTURES to describe what  other novels  he would have written about  great detail  What the reader is left with  is a wonderful  somewhat believable scientific premise  a pretty good  story with utterly one-dimensional  boring characters  a complete  lack of scene development  This is one of those few cases where the movie  is most certainly going to be better than the book
When I first heard about this book, I thought  would be a very good Science Fiction book with plenty of adventure But as I got into , I thought  was very boring  didn't have enough science   Also, I  think this book would have been better without all the swearing Now, this  is the first Crichton book I've tried to read,  I recently learned that  his books generally have swearing  them, but  my point of view, they'd  be better off without  I didn't even finish this book,  I don't plan  to, either
I found the book engaging  didn't want to put  down until &quot;I just finish this next chapter&quot; However I also found  slightly lacking  certain aspects  I LOVE Sci-Fi as Crighton does !  He makes everything seem so possible  attainable  The scientific explanations  were incredible  I felt like I actually knew how to split an atom after  reading this!  However, the characters &amp; actual plot were somewhat  neglected due to this emphasis  Its extremely hard to find that balance   Just WHERE are you going to put your emphasis,  WHEN do you do ,   HOW MUCH Crighton is still a great story teller  The other aspect was the  history involved  Even  you hate Sci-Fi, its STILL a great book  you  LOVE the 14th century  all that goes with   The knights, the castles,  the fights, the language!   But even  this area  was not &quot;all   could be&quot;  Again, how much description can he give?  How much detail  is enough when youre trying to encapsulate this broad story?  Some things  should be forgivenlet  flow as they say  After all, its only  entertainment!  So my breakdown is this:  ScientificallyOUTSTANDING   HistoricallyPLEASINGLY EDUCATIONAL  PlotcharactersSLIGHTLY  OVERLOOKED DUE TO FOCUS ON 1st TWO ASPECTS, YET FORGIVEABLE  This book is  a GREAT READ!  Unless you are counting the hours you have left  this life  why not pick  up &amp; add  to your library  to your head  I read    under a week at a leisurely pace   has given me a lot of food for  thought,  had added another fractal to the dimention that is my mind
I enjoyed the book well enough, but probably won't go see the movie when  comes out The beginning took me  easily  story unfolded smoothly Have to say I found myself thinking that the plot was somewhat similar to  Jurassic Park Nevertheless, Crichton is an excellent author  always  enjoyable to read
I thought Crichton might finally step out of his string of low quality books he has been writing (Airframe  The Lost World)  step back to the genius displayed  his early works (Andromeda Strain, Jurassic Park   Sphere)  Alas, I was disappointed with Timeline  The book starts off  interestingly, presenting a good premise, but  dissolves into a mess of  pointless action scenes that do not hold the book together  Characters are  shallow  the plot is terribly predictable  I keep giving Crichton a  chance to wow me again unfortunately this did not do 
's obvious that Crichton had his eye on a movie deal as he was writing this story The characters are not developed, the setting  France is described  depth(with an overview from a helicopter) the story reads  like a screenplay not a novel The only good writing is  the  introductionToo many Crichton novels have been made into movies Instead  of developing the characters  story himself, he has only provided the  rough outline from which he envisions a director  actors fleshing out  the storySave your time  wait for the movie

Do you believe I actually thought this story was going somewhere?  Next thing I knew I was  one of those gothic romance novels with the knights  the good king  the bad king  the damsel who's as strong  as  daring as most men, but she'll swoon at the touch of her man  Give me a  break  I'm disappointed with his recent work  I guess 's time to remove  Mr Crichton from my Favorite Authors list  Peace  love, Breezee
The future  the past come alive  Michael Crichton's new book Knights  shining blood stained armor, damsels  distress, castles, monks, moats, drawbridges are all part of the wild suspense filled tale Crichton must  have spent the last two  three years locked away  a library doing  research on quantum physics  medieval France, but the final product,  Timeline, was well worth the wait
The plot  characters of this book, which is just Crichton's standard formula, are derived, contrived  absolutely predictable The cast, for there is no doubt that this will be a movie, consists solely of cartoon  characters,  the plot line is nothing more than unrelated &quot;Perils  of Pauline&quot; type skits which are strung together  a flacid attempt  to build tension  suspense leading to the contrived life  death  deadline This book would be good reading for ages 10 to 14
I have read several of Crichton's books,  this is his worst by far  The story just repeats itself over  over  Week plot  Could have been much better I normally like all of Crichton's work, but not this time    I had to read one more fight scene -  I think I would gag
 you are a big fan of Michael Crichton because of his ability to take the bleeding edge of science  make  plausible, you will like the first 30 pages of this book The wonderful quantum physics explanation is the  only redeeming quality of this novel The action  characters are geared  towards their reproduction on the silver screen rather, not  the human  mind The plot is unimaginative , following again the formula of  &quot;create chaos by containment&quot;, trapping the characters  an  environment they can't leave (recall Jurassic Park, Sphere) Frankly, the  action is completely predictable  boring I put the book down several  times  almost didn't pick  up again 's a shame about the plot  because the science behind this story is fascinatingbr After reading  Jurassic Park, I read &quot;Chaos&quot; by Yorke  found Mr Crichton's  research uncannily insightful After reading &quot;Timeline&quot;, I read  &quot;Nanosystems&quot; by Drexler  found gaping holes  Mr Crichton's  explanations of parallel universes  Things just didn't add up The  research effort for this novel seems more minimal than what I would expect  from Mr Crichton based on his previous works  Perhaps my expectations are  too high   br  you are a Crichton fan for the science, I wouldn't  recommend Timeline because you will be disappointed    Historical fans may  delight  the details  archeology, but I would recommend  &quot;The  Eight&quot; by Neville instead
To all of the harsh critics out there I say: Relax! 's Michael Crichton, not Tolstoy! As usual, Crichton has given us an entertaining story along with some interesting passages about an underlying topic ( this case,  quantum mechanics  the middle ages)br I had a blast with this book I  can't wait for the movie, which I am sure will follow
This book has a very interesting plot, loved the scientific references  also the medieval ambience  Very fast reading, once you get into the story you can't get away from   I hope they do the movie someday  Thanks Crichton you did  once again!  Can't wait for the next one
This book pulls you  from the first chapter  The science is very thought provoking, the story spell bindig  the action nail biting  Makes me glad I did not live  the 14th century  No way I would go there without modern weapons  other survival gear  Forsooth!
This book is a very good book,  has an interesting plot, I also like Michael Crichton, but this book is one of his best Even  you do not like the Middle Ages,  is still interesting to read I would reccomend this book to anyone
I loved this book  Once the action starts, you never know what is going to happen next  The research on this time period is extensive  you can tell that Crichton did his homework  I loved   so do many others that I have spoken with  is a definite keeper
When I started reading this book the first thought that popped into my head was, the movie will be coming out any day now   almost seemed like the book was written explicitly for the groundwork on a movie Don't get me wrong, after a slow start the book was very good  moved along quite  well I think  could of been a bit longer Once you get into  the end  comes a bit too quickly The technical aspect of the story was explained  well enough to get a grasp on  without having to re-read passages All   all Crichton has once again delivered quality fiction
Living on the same island (Kauai)as Michael Crichton, I was very happy to be  the unique position to get an autographed copy of this book  you hate action, I can't help you--this novel vibrates  your hands Michael will be the first to tell you that the mechanism of time travel  this  instance is a writers device that his more learned physics-related friends  might take issue with;but elements of his imaginative look at the  possibilities yield tangible aspects I don't want to overexpose--so I'll  just say that the &quot;field buck&quot; phenomenon seems entirely likely  The clock is ticking
i loved this book   was suspenseful  the characters were well-developed   was well-worth losing (a lot of) sleep over all books should be this exciting  thought-provoking ( well-researched) i  highly recommend !
This was a great read!  The scientific theories Crichton presents for timetravel are believable  He takes the reader  whisks you away on a action packed thriller set  the middle ages  Crichton puts you  the  heart of life back  the 1400's, with all the terrors  dangers of  medievil life  The characters are well developed  easy to relate to,  the plot is spellbinding,  the overall story is so delicious that you  cannot put  down!  A must read for anyone!
Timeline was very informative yet fun Their adventures were numerous  involved many people  interesting facts about the Middle Ages I would recomend  to all who like the Middle Ages  lots that don't
I am a great fan of Michael Crichton  eagerly anticipated reading this book  I was not disappointed  The idea of travelling back  time has always fascinated me (see movie - Somewhere  Time)   does sound  romantic  His book was like a catalyst for my imagination on what  is  like to be  the medieval period  I can almost smell the chaos he was  describing  You can almost feel the thundering noise of the horses  the  vibration of metal against metal when Crichton describe the battle scenes    is an amazing book  I was glad I read 
 from M Crichton I was a bit skeptical  the first few pages, testing the waters whether  not I should find something else to read, when I found myself reading faster  faster, trying to figure out what  will happen next Not exactly sci-fi, not really a full blown thriller, but  an exciting book to read
I have always been a big fan of Mr Crichton's work,  as such was very sorry to find that not only COULD I put this book down, I did, frequently  I can't help but think that a possibly great story line slipped through his  fingers
As with some of the other reviews, I thought the beginning took off rather slow  predictable  But like all 9 of the books by Crichton I've read, I was soon hooked  Neither Medieval History nor Time travel would have lured me to this book but Crichton's name did,  I'm glad  did  Whenever I put down the book, I felt like acquaintances of mine were  trapped  I must continue to read as quickly as possible until their  fates have played out  Keep writing Michael! I am looking forward to your  next book  will go back  read the few I have missed  I hope there is  a screenplay  the works as I can't wait to see the movie!
As he has done  many of his prior novels, Crichton has again used new technology to create a powerful story This time he uses quantum technology  about  he writes, &quot;Quantum technology flatly contradicts our  common sense ideas of how the world works  posits a world where  computers operate without being turned on  objects are found without  looking for them An unimaginably powerful computer can be built from a  single molecule Information moves instantly between two points, without  wires  networks Distant objects are examined without any contact  Computers do their calculations  other universes  teleportation is  ordinary  used  many different ways&quot; This quote is from  Crichton's introduction; scientists have already learned this much about  the strange quantum world, but they know little about how to manipulate   Crichton greatly expands upon these strange features of the quantum worlds  to help make the concept of time travel believablebr  this novel, a  group of historians  grad students are working on the re-creation of a  medieval castle  town  France, commissioned by ITC, a company run by  billionaire Robert Doniger, a brilliant, but somewhat deranged physicist  The research group assumes  is a typical research grant until they are  called  on a special mission - to return to the actual time they are  studying to help find their friend  colleague, Professor Johnston, who  is lost  that world Their travels are beset by violent knights, warlords   other dangers The world of medieval France is not a peaceful one   has frequent battles, thievery, sword fights, rape, disease  random acts  of violence The group must rely on what know about this world through  their observations of  centuries  the future  order to survive the  ordeal  rescue the professor br Michael Crichton, who has penned some  of the best-known titles of the 90's including Jurrasic Park, Congo,  Disclosure, Airframe  Rising Sun, has written another appealing  action-thriller that evokes the chilling consequences of a possible future  technology Crichton also does an amazing job of recreating the feudal  lifestyle of 14th century France as a time of great violence His  recreation of the weapons, armor, fights, people  lifestyle of this time  period is fascinating Timeline is a very visual  fast-moving novel that  is sure to please Crichton fans
I really enjoyed Timeline   was my favorite since Congo  I enjoyed most of the characters  the historical  the cool fake science stuff  Not a science geek, but knew he was stretching!  Still,  is fiction   Cool scenes keeping  small  large at the same time  Better than  Jurassic Park series  Crighton still mixes science, adventure  cool  plot twist expertely
This is the best book I have ever read is extremely well written   kept me glued until the very last pageYou really get to actually care for the characters as you follow their adventureI couldn't believe some of the  reviews saying  was boring! A great book for the mature croud will  always stay  my heart!
This book is not just a fantasy for a historian, archaeologist,  science prodigies  We have a modern account  a paradigm of technology that is present  our culture National physicists actually hold Crichton's  quantum theories valid that lends wonderful believeability  this story   We live this adventure as history is eloquently depicted as something we  should learn as we become aware of modern society's legacies   you read  one page of this book, do yourself a favor  read p73 ( the hardbound  text) to decipher what is a &quot;temporal provincialist&quot;   is nice  to see a fresh perspective that is visionary  science  yet warns some  of the adverse affects when one tries to conform the world unto their  hisher theories   you want to be more grateful about Amercian society   laws despite our widespread negativity, then you should read this  account  I have even dreamed about the &quot;next step&quot; of time  travel  full detail of this vivid book
Michael Crichton's book Timeline is equivelent to Jurassic Park   is a masterpiece  Timeline is brilliant   actually explains how &quot;time travel&quot; could be possible   is an epic  my eyes; an epic for the  new millenium        This book will keep you reading past midnight    will scare you, excite you,  amaze you with its infinite possibilities   Like most of Crichton's work,  is filled with great suspense  This book  has forever changed the way I look at the world around me  I am much more  open-minded now that I have read this momentous novel      This book is  filled with believable theories   is easy to understand because   doesn't escape into mathematics to explain the theories  facts behind  &quot;time travel&quot;  This book will open your eyes to the  possibilities of the physics we unwittingly deal with every daybr      I  was awestruck by the technologies which were explained thorougly until I  began to pay attention to the deep plot which peacefully coexisted with  these theories  remained constant through-out the entire bookbr Michael  Crichton is a genius
I loved this book   was fun, entertaining reading that immeidately captures your attention  Unfortunately by the very end everything happens just as you'd imagine  Most of the characters while interesting didn't  develop as completely as I would have hoped  's obvious that Mr  Crichton spent a great deal of time researching the issues of Quantum  Physics, Medieval History  Architecture  But he didn't spend a lot of  time creating fully three dimensional characters  plot twists that leave  one guessing  Yes, there are a couple of twists that are fun (males  turning into females, that sort of thing), but mostly everything happens as  one would expect  Interestingly enough  still manages to be suspensful  because of Crichton's incredible talent  weaving a tale of action   is  an action book    will make a great action thriller  's very  interesting that Mr Crichton can write action so masterfully that even  though you know what's going to happen, 's still suspensful finding out   But Mr Crichton, I know you can do better with more -depth characters   plot twists  Bottom line: buy , read , enjoy , wait for the  movie, ride the attraction at Disney someday  look forward to his next  book!
My goodness, this was an unoriginal, clich-ridden,  predictable piece of junk  Scientists  historians travel through time back to medieval Europe  CAN'T GET BACKimagine!   you've ever read A CONNECTICUT  YANKEE  KING ARTHUR'S COURT  seen a bad STAR TREK holodeck episode, you  already know the whole story  will guess the ending long before the  halfway point  One could have forgiven the lack of originality, though,   the writing was up to Crichton's best  TIMELINE, however, is a wandering  mess, the plot bursting with outrageous contrivances, tangential,  unresolved subplots-a suspicious policeman's investigation disappears  without a trace halfway through the book- the lamest  &quot;cliffhangers&quot; you're likely to find this side of Superman  I  finished this dud slack-jawed, not wanting to believe that one of my  favorite authors could publish such rubbish  Unfortunately, he can  he  did
This book is one of the best I have read  a long time  Once I started I couldn't put  down, two days   was done  Thought provoking  well written, as well as very easy to read
My goodness, this was an unoriginal, clich-ridden,  predictable piece of junk  Scientists  historians travel through time back to medieval Europe  CAN'T GET BACKimagine!   you've ever read A CONNECTICUT  YANKEE  KING ARTHUR'S COURT  seen a bad STAR TREK holodeck episode, you  already know the whole story  will guess the ending long before the  halfway point  One could have forgiven the lack of originality, though,   the writing was up to Crichton's best  TIMELINE, however, is a wandering  mess, the plot bursting with outrageous contrivances, tangential,  unresolved subplots-a suspicious policeman's investigation disappears  without a trace halfway through the book- the lamest  &quot;cliffhangers&quot; you're likely to find this side of Superman  I  finished this dud slack-jawed, not wanting to believe that one of my  favorite authors could publish such rubbish  Unfortunately, he can  he  did
This is a very solid time-waster of a sci-fi thriller from one of the more competent sci-fithriller writers around  This time, Crichton has invented a time machine  contemporary America  sends his protagonists to  fourteenth century France, where they do not receive a warm welcome  The  prose is workmanlike, there is some suspense,  the book provides a  diverting few afternoons entertainment  So what  the end is predictable,  the portrayal of corporate officers cliched,  some loose ends are left  hanging (what happened to the New Mexico cop?)?  He gets credit for placing  his book  an unusual milieu, which is well-researched  I can correctly  recall my college medieval history coursesbr Buy    paperbackbr (People who like time-travel fiction are well advised to seek  out LSprague DeCamp's classic sci-fi novel Lest Darkness Fall (set after  the fall of Rome during the age of Belisarius  Justinian), which though  dated ('s about fifty years old) is very well done  a light read, even    could have been longer)
This book is able to plunge you  the nearby future so as  the last past Is difficult nowadays to think as a Middle Ages man, Micheal Crichton is able to do that I am waiting for the movie version Thanks Micheal
Excellent reading  Thoroughly enjoyed this book I love Micheal Crichton  can't wait for his next work !
This ill-conceived  badly written trash doesn't deserve comment  I'm using this space to alert discriminating readers to one of the best,  long-neglected writers  the English language  Patrick O'Brian   your tastes run to historyadventure, wedded to literature, read his seafaring  tales  the AubreyMaturin series  You'll not be disappointed
Michael Crichton's most recent masterpiece, Timeline, is one of Michael Crichton's best novels yet Timeline goes into the past, into the dark  gloomy middle ages about twenty years into the Hundred Years War Timeline is extremely exciting  adventurous  will definitely be made into a  movie like the rest of Crichton's novels This novel is a little slow at  the beginning, but when a team goes back  time to the 1300s to rescue a  man, action comes instantly This is the turning point to when you realize  this novel is extremely well written At this point action starts pouring  on especially when two of the group members get bumped off right at the  beginning when the group goes back  time I would recommend this book to  people who are science fiction fanatics  you liked Jurassic Park, The  Lost World   fact any of Michael Crichton's books,  I guarantee you  will enjoy this masterpiece
I was over 50 pages into Timeline, complaining that  something didn't change soon I was going to drop the book on the shelf  forget about   had been uninventive, predictable  --  my opinion -- poorly written On page 91, the book reached that pinnacle event when I said  \\"Wow!\\"  knew I wouldn't be able to put  down  never  became great, but for a lover of science fiction  history Timeline was  worth reading despite the slow start    Timeline begins with a company   the New Mexico desert called ITC This company seems to be connected to the  a mentally disturbed old man found wandering  the desert The man speaks   cryptic rhymes, something about \\"quantum foam,\\" before he  suddenly dies from cardiac arrest  the old man's affects is an  architectural drawing of a monastery that hasn't existed since the  fourteenth century    The old man, the monastery Sainte-Mere,  ITC would  seem unconnected at first, but  just so happens that ITC is sponsoring an  archeological dig  France where this monastery once stood Led by Dr  Edward Johnson, a group of young graduate students are trying to uncover  the town of Castlegard, Sainte-Mere,  the castle La Roque    Crichton  draws some very two-dimensional characters at first, but through the course  of the book he continues to flush them out, making some of them quite  interesting Chris is a young man, always falling  love, whose specialty  is mills of the 14th century Andre is a tough, rugged sort whose love of  the era has led him to live his life learning everything about the time  period (including the languages) Kate, a tough architectural history  student with a penchant for mountain climbing Her ability to hang from  heights comes  handy when studying the tops of crumbling  chapels    Everything is going well for the archeological team until  representatives from ITC show up  demand that the project be  accelerated Things have been moving too slowly for the company,  their  stockholders demand results for their continued support Dr Johnson  returns to the States to argue his position  soon disappears The  students don't know what to do  his absence Then they uncover a  startling discover beneath the ruins of the old monastery: a plea for help   the good doctor's handwriting    As always with Crichton, the science   the science fiction is very important While some people may be put off by  his tangential discussions regarding quantum mechanics, he is acutely aware  that many of his readers are not science fiction fans, so he tones down the  \\"geek factor\\" as much as possible He does his best to avoid the  technical jargon  uses simple metaphors to explain some very difficult  concepts, including why time paradoxes cannot occur    Unlike Jurassic  Park, where dinosaurs were the most important characters, science is merely  a vehicle to this story  is evident that Crichton is either genuinely  interested  14th century France,  he loves doing research His eye for  detail is fascinating, ranging from hygiene  customs to architecture   industry I found myself wondering  Crichton had written Timeline merely  to utilize this wealth of information     truth, Michael Crichton made  several writing mistakes that a beginning author could never make  still  hope to get published His story opens on characters who bear no relevance  on the rest of the novel The first 50 odd pages do little to advance the  real story  hindsight, I think Crichton would benefit from a good  editor    Nevertheless, Crichton manages to take science ( science  fiction)  blend  into a mainstream story that will appeal to fans of  history  time travel
 was evident after the first few pages that Mr Crichton had done serious research on this book  The action was amazing,  the concepts that the book touched on  the historical aspect definetely make this one  worth reading  I'm interested to see what Hollywood's feeback will be
This novel is an enjoyable romp for people who love historical fiction  &quot;Timeline&quot; is rich  vivid recreactions of medieval life, 's the best book I've read since the &quot;The Triumph &amp; the Glory&quot;  last Christmas,  that was way back  the 1900's  Crichton has always  been one of my favorite writers  didn;t let me down with his latest
Timeline was another exciting adventure from Michael Crichton He is a great mind who has a very interesting ideas, ie faxing people to parallel dimentions Timeline was not his best but  is a must read for Crichton  fans I enjoyed  immensely
Michael Crichton writes science fiction that somehow avoids being  genre-typed as Science Fiction  Because his genre is Best Seller, I suppose,  maybe because 's really lousy science fiction   His formula  is to paint a pseudo-scientific background with broad, glib strokes Then,  to create some kind of deadline for a set of cut-out characters to race  against to a breathless, but oddly anti-climactic, conclusion  Notice how  many of his books have times  dates as chapter titles  br br   the  latest iteration, he invokes a bunch of quantum physics  some  mumbo-jumbo about molecular computers to send a  gaggle of  historianarchaeologists back to France  the Year of Our Lord 1357 Then,  he  thinks very deeply about the Medieval culture to conclude--guess  what--that people back then were just like us, only more open about their  aggression  The action toggles  back  forth between bloody sword play   the past  corporate animus  the  present   br  The chapters that  take place  the past have time titles like &quot;30:45:15&quot; because  the students are stuck  the past, see,  they only have 37 hours to get  back to their time machines before they will be trapped  the past forever   every second counts  This is the countdown, get ?  's a Timeline   Except, they've gone back to rescue their professor, who over-stayed his  time machine on a previous trip--so maybe someone else could come  get  them  they  miss the bus  So what's the big rush already?  I don't  know--something about parallel universes  transcription errors br  How  did they get stuck  France--during a castle siege yet? (which is even  worse than a Metro strike)   Well, remember the 100 year storm that takes  out the control room   Jurassic Park  lets all the dinosaurs loose   Well this time, 's an explosion  the  time machine control room    the good guys would be able to fix things okay except the dastardly  computer geniusbusiness mogul who invented the time machine keeps getting    the way  He's really nasty, kind of like Bill you-know-who  Never  says please  thank you  A real bad-un  All this happens  the first 50  pages, so I haven't given anything away, yet br  The chapters  the  present have place names like &quot;Black Rock, New Mexico&quot;   This is  handy  case you forget whether you're  the past  the present   Another  clue is when one of the good guys  the past gets  a real  jam--like someone's about to  get chopped  half by a big ax,   looks  like a good guy's been blown up  a big explosion,  maybe a good guy is  hanging over the edge of a really big cliff--this happens several times,  hence the term &quot;cliff hanger&quot;  Anyway, when one of these  exciting things happens, then that's a sign that a new chapter will begin  on the next page   will be called &quot;Ft Stockton: Outside the Gas  Station&quot;  something like that    we'll have to read on  helplessly, while the evil computer nerd steps on puppy dog tails    refuses to return library books  Did I mention that he's really bad? br   What's this geek up to anyway?  Why is he sending ex-marines back through  time  buying lots of real estate  France? (as  a billionaire needed  a good reason to buy castles  France)  This emerges as a point of  unbelievable suspense during the book Even though there's tons of other  suspense to go around, I suppose I could really spoil things  I told  you Want to guess?  Want to avert your eyes?  Here  comes, the BIG  SPOILER br  The bad guy wants to build a chain of amusement parks based on  historical themes  (Does this remind you of something?) br  Yup, he's  invented a way to travel back  time  to anywhere  the universe   to all the parallel universes--which turn out to be everywhere,  the  most profitable use he can think of for  is to do  really accurate  research for themeparks Golly This must be why all these computer geeks  business types are billionaires  all the physicists  archaeologists I  know are scrambling for post-doc positions br  Well, all I can say is,   you have time on your hands  someone gave your this book  there's  nothing much else to read--like say you're on a long flight  the  computer geek who had your seat on the last flight took off with all the  Sky Mall catalogs--then reading &quot;Timeline&quot; would not actually  cause your brain to turn to quantum foam  run out your nostrils  Buying  this book at hard cover prices though, now that would be a bad time
Entertaining storyyet overdone  many ways   evolves into a total action movie, with one action sequence after another,  too many James Bond type improbable escapes  incredibly lucky breaksbasically not  something you would expect from Crichton Also, scientifically the concepts  were cloudy at best My 2 stars are for idea
Silly  Perils of Pauline nonsense  Weak characterization  plotting  Not satisfied with cliffhangers, ad infinitum, Crichton insults us further by attaching sub-cliffhangers to each I browsed through the book  the  public library  was impressed with the extensive bibliography With all  this backup, the book must be great  Right?  What a disappointment  I  doubt that he used 1% of   Just another prop
The only problem I had with this book is that  is less than 500 pages As I got near the end of the book I kept hoping the story would keep going When you get a book this enjoyable you don't want  to end so soon The  story is great  the characters are very real I hope there is a sequel  soon br Don't miss this book
I've read most of Criton's books  have enjoyed them all  Unfortunately, this one wasn't up to the high standards set by the others  The &quot;time travel&quot; technology is poorly explained as follows:  &quot;we don't know why  work but  does&quot;  C'mon, loyal Sci-Fi  fans deserve better than that  Jurassic Park had thorough believable  explanations   I could come up with at least five better scenarios to  explain he technology  this book  Perhaps being TOO true to the theories  of quantum physics was the downfall  Although the book was  fact  enjoyable,  shoulg be noted that the story is quite flat: single goal  with predictable end  I needn't go on  Now that I think about , this  book was more a 3 than a 4  Sorry Michael
While the premise is engaging  several tantilizing notions, concepts,  ideas are alluded to  the first half of the book, ranging from time paradoxes to multiple universes, few of any of these otherwise interesting  ideas are ever broached  the book's second half  Granted, the book was a  page turner, but the page turning aspect seemed more attributable to the  author's pedigree  track record than to the text itself  I trust Mr  Crichton's storytelling based on the integrity of his earlier works which  contain elements that have been instilled  timelines narrative  plot;  however, despite page-turning  seach of a payoff, the payoff here never  arrives   the end, the book diverges from Mr Crichton's other works   that the characters are ostensibly mired  one long chase, intellectual  resources are rarely brought to bear to solve problems at hand,  there  are some contradictions  holes  the science that  other books  (Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Sphere) both ground the logic of the  premise  readily suspend disbelief  While entertaining, the book's  early promise, which so successfully piqued my interest, is unfulfilled by  story's end  A strong ending,  which many of the ideas  concepts that  are alluded to earlier  the book, would have greatly improved the book by  providing a satisfying conclusion to an otherwise provocative story idea   As is, the book is like Michael Crichton light- better than most, but less  than what the author is capable of
I thought the book was exellent!  Even though Timeline is the first of Michael Chrichton's books that I've read  I am astounded that so many other customer reviews are negative because I truly enjoyed this book from  beginning to the end could have been a bit better  I did not like Andre  remaining  the other universe  when they found out about Andre's life  at the end   just didn't seem right    the thing with the  earpieces I agree with a previous reviewer that the whole translating  thing was a bit ridiculous   All  all I did have fun reading this book   I will definately read his others
Timeline was written around some interesting concepts like quantum computers, interdimentional time travel  what  was like 650 years ago  had its moments where  Crichton's explanations of these concepts I was  hooked br However, the plot was weak  the story wasn't realy well  written  seemed that he hastily came up with an end to 
I have to agree with the review below from Kickstand  Timeline was the first Crichton book i had read  From Timeline I read Jurassic ParkI know i was the only person left on earth that had not READ  SEEN   I  cannot believe how alike they are is almost insulting to the  readerbr When I read Timeline I liked  quite a bit, i thought the  technology, the plot  the time period were all very clever Little did I  know  was the same story as Juassic   makes me want to dust off the  typewriter  make an easy couple of million
Pack your bags for this mind boggling adventure This book is not only informative but  is truly fascinating  exciting  I admit that there were times where the plot became too tense that i had to put the book down  to catch my breath  is a ride  an incredible read
I had the opportunity to give a 15 minute presentation on a SF book for a college course I was taking  I had heard about this book, but really didn't know what  was about  I bought the book  had  finished  within two days-very unusual for me  I love the way Crichton plays with  the thoughts of medieval history  the 100 Years War  I think there are  many other movies  aspects that he ties : The Matrix, 13th Floor, The  Time Machine, Star Gate, A Canticle for Leibowitz  I also liked the way  he portrayed the time period  None of the romatics stuff people usually  think of I would recommend this to anyone   is really facinating!
Pack your bags for this mind boggling adventure This book is not only informative but  is truly fascinating  exciting  I admit that there were times where the plot became too tense that i had to put the book down  to catch my breath  is a ride  an incredible read
A rather boring book  Draws attention to what is possibly interesting science, however unable to hold the readers interest  the plot  The book just drags on forever  Have to agree with some other readers that this  book seems to have been written with a movie script  mind  Skip this  booksave some time, energy  money
I really can't say much about this book as the story doesn't have enough substance to critic but  they do make  into a movie I hope they go for the comedy genre The guy who had the lead  the 1999 movie &quot;The  Mummy&quot; would be great for one of the leads
This book was so intriguing, so utterly interesting that I could not put  down I don't know how you can not like this!  I liked how wierd Doniger wasbr      That's my sixth grade sonbut I loved this book too   Sometimes a fast, exciting read can be fun  This was actually my favorite  MC book by far   certainly would make a great movie!
All those bad reviews!  What do you expect  This is not literary fiction  Take this book for what  is - very good escapism  Enjoy the story as you will enjoy the upcoming movie
Because of plenty of action, I found this book a good read which kept my attention I had to get past plenty of drawbacks, however, first  foremost Crichton's unending trademark lecturing  Also, as a previous  reviewer noted, parallel universes is a tough one to swallow, quantum  physics  no  Face , that was a feeble catch-all to get around the  paradox dilemna   Another problem with the time travel concept is why,  once we've developed the technology, we are not being visited by future  travellers, who would be benefitting by perfected technology? This  many  other questions are left unanswered by this story    To enjoy this book,  accept  for what  is, a fantasy--but wait for the paperback
That pretty much sums  up  This book has an interesting concept that's not as well executed as  could be  I recommend another book I just read-- THE ROCK by Doherty  Another interesting concept but executed  a  more exciting manner
At first I didn't understand the detail of the archeology dig, but after chapter 1, I was hooked  I would read until my eyes crossed  then read more
That's not a complimentbr I think Crichton took his manuscript of Jurassic Park,  did a search--replace with his word processor The word &quot;dinosaur&quot; gets replaced with &quot;knight&quot;, etc etc
After reading many of the reviews of Timeline, I didn't really have high hopes for the book Most readers had come to the conclusion that the book was tedious  ran on too long, but I decided to see for myself The book  certainly wasn't the most exciting that I had ever read, but  was  definitely an engaging novel The incorporation of medieval history was  very appealing since 's a subject matter that I didn't have much  knowledge about Crichton has always had a knack for blending a wealth of  factual information into a fictional novel,  this was the case when   came to his dealings with thirteenth century history The action  the  book was pretty good,  the plot was quite good once you got beyond the  whole time-travel thing  focused on the events taking place  the past  The characters weren't developed all that well,   was plain that  Crichton had concentrated much more on story line than on the characters  The one aspect of this novel that I found to be truly disappointing was  Crichton's signature incorporation of science into the plot Breaking down  quantum physics to the point that the average person can comprehend  is a  difficult task, I must admit, but even so  was not accomplished very  well Even the books characters are baffled by the explanations provided,   there are several instances where the events of the novel occur   defiance of the physical laws described  the book Despite this  shortcoming, I would still judge Timeline as a fairly enjoyable book, but   should be noted that pretty much anything seems interesting when you've  been snowed  for two weeks straight!
This book as many other Crichton books keeps the reader on the edge of their seat while providing a very interesting discussion of science  history I want to address the reviewer who suggested that his book was  full of inconsistencies The characters don't change history because the  things that they appeared to go back  change actually already happened  So the message: HELP ME, written by one of the characters  the 14th  century to get the attention of the characters  the present was actually  there all along because  the past that person was there to put the  message there Therefore the person who left the message  the past could  possibly have seen the message even before they went back  left  This  subject is rather hard to comprehend,  just appeared that they had  changed history but they didn't because those actions already had occured  even though the person had not done them yet This is addressed when one of  the characters states the fact that when you transverse universes to travel  back  time cause  effect are reversed so that an effect happens before   is even caused At one point  the story one of the characters  addresses the issue of time paradox's, such as you going back  the past   killing your grandfather  you not existing as a result of that   is correctly addressed that these don't exist because  you went back   history the person that you killed would not be your grandfather  the  present time  would be someone else because the person who you thought  you killed was not actually your grandfather Because the effect happens  before the cause  this case, your grandfather cannot be the person you go  back to kill  you would not be born  the first place The effect (you  being born) obviously had to be caused by you not killing your real  grandfather Clearly this subject is very abstract  confusing, but I see  no scientific inconsistencies  this book Of course I could be way off  base but I have thought about   I think my explanation while abstract  is correct As a result of this I believe this book makes you think a great  deal  is also extremely interesting  intense The fact that he was  able to tie  modern quantum mechanics with 14th century French history is  simply spectacular This is a must read for anyone interested  science   history
I had the impression I was reading a description of Riven  some other computer game, rather than a book  Unlike Congo, Eaters of the Dead  Sphere, the science is minimal, unbelievable  uninteresting  The plot  moves from event to event  a plodding, uneven fashion  Look, I'm a big  Michael Crichton fan,  I'll read most anything he writes  But I had the  impression he scribbled this between ER episodes,  while reading old  Scientific American issues  I just think he didn't put enough effort into  the story
I agree with many of the previous reviews:  reads like a screenplay, weak character development,  way too much overdone action   started out with so much potential, then got increasingly worse as I read  I had to  suspend my disbelief far too often  For example, we are told that  is  impossible to travel  time; instead, the characters are traveling to  \\"mulitverses\\" which are other universes similar to our own  Yet,  the professor travels to another multiverse,  leaves a message that the  historians find hundreds of years later  The message was written  a  different universe than the one the historians existed   How did they  get this message?  Am I missing something here?  The explanations   analogies that are given to disprove time paradoxes are not at all  convincing  Since when can an individual NOT impact the outcome of  history?   those stupid ear pieces?   the team of historians needed  translations, how did the people of the 14th century understand the  historians without a translator?  So much was left unexplained  Granted, I  don't know much about quantum physics, but a lot of this stuff just wasn't  adding up     Everything was so predictable  We see Marek practicing his  jousting,  we automatically know he's going to go back to the 14th  century  joust  How convenient that Kate is a climber  finds herself  climbing on ceiling beams  crumbling rooftops  Puke  I could go on   on  I have loved many of Michael Crichton's books, but this one was a  complete flop  I was shocked that he could take such fascinating subject  matter  write something so stupid  At least he spared most of the  suffering plot from mushy romances  Let's just hope that Crichton is  afflicted with a temporary brain fart  will recover shortly
I'm a history buff  I expected more of a history story I had high hopes, never having read Crichton before, but I was very disappointed  was more like watching a movie than reading a book  was just one \\"scene\\"  after another  an Indiana Jones movie at that Our heroes go from  cliffhanger to cliffhanger, from one close call to another  was tiring  to read  the characters were so one-dimensional The book had nothing  to do really with history  time travel  was just an excuse for a big  adventure, on-the-edge-of-your-seat type movie
The science  Timeline is fairly interesting, but the book ultimately drags on waaaay too long  The action scenes get pretty redundant, the characters never really came alive for me  I haven't really liked a  Crichton book since DisclosureAirframe was just okay,  I actually  gave up on the Lost World after 100  so pages  I really hope Crichton's  next book is much better
I've always liked Crichton books for the way  which he weaves cutting edge scientific theory into adventure fiction  br Although Timeline provided plenty of action,  was much shorter on the science  The  continuous fighting  action scenes will make a fine action movie, but  provide little help for the novel  br While Crichton's books are difficult  to put down because of the action, I found his science  this book to be  remarkably inconsistent  Crichton spent numerous pages explaining how time  travel paradoxes don't exist because nothing a person does  another  universe affects this one  Then, he allows more than one character to  alter history, thereby making his whole book inconsistent  br 's  possible I get too worked up over an otherwise entertaining novel, but by  the end I wanted to throw the book against the wall because of the  scientific inconsistencies  br My suggestion -  Crichton wants to write  screen plays, write a screen play   he wants to write a book, write a  book  He's got a very good grasp of scientific theory, I just hope he  doesn't try  mix the movies  novels again  (I can just see the  sequel to Timeline -  you thought Lost World was made for the movies!)
Author had a great concept but failed to follow through with a great book  I eagerly bought this book when  was released  quickly became bored with  up until the end  Characters were shallow  the author posed a  week argument against the paradoxes associated with time-travel  I give  this one a ho-hum  (Nice beginning  ending, but the middle was  painfully boring)
This book is soooo boring  Give me another &quot;Airframe&quot; anytime
With such a great concept, this could have been much better I usually can't put Crichton books down but I had to work to wade through this, at times  the many, many plot holes were big enough to drive trucks  through The unnecessarily gory violence could have been much more subtly  handled A disappointment
This book is awful   you have any science  sci-fi background, you'll see his plot is inconsistent with itself  Plus he didn't think through the fact that,  time travel were even possible, the team could have simply  gone back to the time of the original problem  grabbed the subject of  the whole tedious search for themselves  Don't bother  Re-read Jurassic  Park instead!
Well developed plot line  Enjoyed this book tremendously  The research that was done for the medeival period was tremendous
A masterpiece! Chricton takes the concept of quantum time travel  gives the reader a mind boggling experience with great historic  scientific refernece Great for history buffs  science nerds alike!
This is at least the fifth Crichton book I have read cover to cover without really taking a break, going all the way back to Andromeda Strain Hard to imagine, given his background, that  wouldn't read a little bit  like a movie, so I'm not sure why anyone would complain about that br I  look at  this way: 's the literary equivalent of junk food, but 's  made with the very finest ingredients Enjoy!
Not your typical Crichtonbut  kept me interested throughout  is a page turner
I was so excited by the premise of this novel that I had trouble waiting until Christmas had passed to buy  Unfortunately,  read like a lump of coalbr I have to agree with other reviewers who panned this one for lack  of depth, mechanical story elements, weak characterization,  a sense of  impending Hollywoodbr  you are looking for a good Crichton read, try  Airframe  Sphere Don't bother with this silly book
A bit of a disappointment  I can appreciate the research, the science  the history but this book goes on  on  on br Each event is predictable  ultimately boring  Also there are bad editing errors which  detract from the action  How can a character be on a beam she thinks is  too wide (six inches) on one page  cross to another &quot;smaller&quot;  beam that is a foot wide 2 pages later?  Did more than one person write  this book?br 's frustrating when an author writes the movie before he's  even finished the book!
For the first half of this book, I was wildly enthusiastic, couldn't put  down  Then the action got so heavy, the characters remained weakly drawn,  I found myself skipping over sections that were way too detailed  but also boring  I hung  there to see what would happen, realizing that  this book reads like a movie screenplay,  hungering to learn more about  the PEOPLE  Too much action,  quick, unsatisfying ending  The suspense  of finding out what Doniger was up to didn't live up to the discovery   Formula Crichton:  mega-research, weak characters, quick ending  I used to  LOVE Crichton:  is  me  him?
&quot;Timeline&quot; reads, unfortunately, like a movie   does a wonderful job of bringing history to life   is confusing at times,  leaves several things unexplainedbr Action packed (too much), light,  fluffy, politically correct  Weak endingbr I fear Crichton  has abandoned  me,  slightly insulted me  the process (first Lost World  now  this)br He is an incredibly talented thinker  storyteller  So what  happened?br Please tell me why I should ever read another book by him
This book had a great idea  then failed completely to follow through on  There was so much more that Crichton could have explored! What really bother me was the totally mechanical structure to each chapter Each one  ended with a crisis for one  two of the characters which the others then  had to rescue them from  the next chapter This was repeated so many  times  was laughable The book seemed to be written on autopilot
This book is nonstop action but too nuch like JP to be great The characters were pretty shallow  the dialogue was a bit lame but  was a really interesting story  a good sci-fi book, although all the science  is revealed rather quickly Some stuff, like why the people were  reassambled  the past-history universe was unexplained( was only  quickly explained that they were actually reassembled from yet another  universe, but that made no sense, also, why the old guy ended up  the  middle of a desert, not the laboratory, was never revealed)
I was disappointed Having read all of his other books,  being very interested  both physics &amp; mediaeval history, I thought I'd love this book The science parts are interesting,  the history seems well  researched, but the plot lets  down The whole story seemed to be one  sword fight after another The characterisations seemed a bit cartoonish   one dimensional too, with the evil  brusque corporation head, the  wise college professor, the college students who are having the adventure  (including the brainy kid, the girl, the leader, &amp; the love-sick guy),   the nasty soldiers who are plotting evil plots They Must Be Stopped!  Before 's Too Late! Pass me a bucketbr Mind you, with all the action  going on, I did keep turning the pages But once  was finished, I didn't  feel like I'd read a great book All  all,  this is turned into a  movie,  will be rated G, play  the school holidays,  will sell many  action figures
This book is a testament to what happens when successful authors get big advances -- from movie studios  The entire novel is clearly a screenplay  There are lavish descriptions of the sets which will doubtless be featured   the future Hollywood blockbuster, but almost no character development  's impossible to understand why people are doing what they are doing, but  we can all cheer as the baddies get their arms lopped off  the heroine  uses a &quot;hasta lavista, baby&quot; type line here  there  I have to  contrast this with Thomas Harris's &quot;Hannibal&quot; (also a book which  doubtless received a huge movie option fee) which may be unfilmable, since   deals so much with the internal life of the charaters, but which is a  much better readbr I admit I was swept up  the action, which is  tremendous, but at the end I felt slightly ashamed of myself  This book  will have you casting the movie however -- Brendan Frasier as the muscular  wanna-be knight, etc?br Overall, this is the most intellectually vacuous of  Crichton's novels, which is saying something  I'm done with this guy
Out with the raptors  bring on the jousters!   Jurassic Park Crichton brought the past to the present   his latest offering, Timeline, he sends the present back to the past  Once again we have a meglomaniac  billionaire using state-of-the-art technology to try  build a better  theme park(Do these guys belong to a club  something?)  Despite the plot  similarities to Jurassic Park this is a very entertaining read  Crichton  devises a new twist on time travel(think Fantastic Voyage meets Sliders)   the reader is transported to Medieval France  Once there Crichton  keeps the pages turning with a thrill-a-minute yet educational narrative of  life  the 14th century  Villianous lords, unscrupulous knights   ever-changing loyalties keep the time travelers( the reader) from  catching their breathe  Despite the fact that an action-packed movie is  sure to be made from the book,  doesn't have the contrived feel of  &quot;Lost World&quot;(Come on, we all know Malcolm was dead at the end of  the book version of Jurassic Park)  So  you want to enjoy a rollicking  read  learn a little history at the same time, check out  &quot;Timeline&quot;!
I enjoy Mr Crichton's work  this new book is a great read  The theme of quantum physics induced multiverse time travel is fascinating  The detailed interpretation of the zeitgeist of France  England during the  Hundred Years is engaging   you are interested  historical  fictionsuspense  like a good, fast,  exciting read, this book is for  you
I am a Crichton fan  have read most of his books Timeline missed the mark by far A couple of decent chapters but I found the book to be pretty boring I had a hard time finishing this piece Are we sure Crichton really  wrote this book?
Timeline was the first book I've ever read by Chrichton   was a little slow until the characters actually go back  time; once they step out into feudal France the plot becomes a roller coaster that never slows down until  the last seconds  I'm not a historian, so I learned quite a few things  about life during that time periodbr I did have a few problems with   though  The author didn't spend much time on character development - each  character has a brief physical description,  a brief list of qualities  (that coincidentally help them later when battling for their lives)  The  fact that Marek is so prepared for the journey back  time by his personal  interests  training gives away the ending earlybr I didn't think the  author presented a believable explanation for time travel, which would have  made the plot seem more authentic  Another thing I didn't like is the  presentation of the \\"Big Bang\\" theory as an explanation for the origins of  the Universe as fact - when 's only a theorybr The book is highly  entertaining, however,  well (WELL) researched  There's not a lot of  romantic goo slowing down the action part of the book, which makes the  pages fly by
Timeline is the first of micheal crichton's work that i've read,  Its just awesome, i couldn't put  down on a scale of 1-10 i'd give  a 20, its really good
Having read all of Crichton's works, I have to rate this up there with the best of them I love the plots  counterplots, the technical aspects,  the attention to detail he is so good at This would make a great movie,  but they'd probably mess  up
Loved the book from the start Crichton's explanations of the technology  involved are just enough to make  seem completely plausible without  making the story boring,  the fascinating portrayal of everyday life   1300s France was engrossing, especially  light of what we all think we  know from history classes  our own perceptions of the time The  characters are well-developed through the story,  a couple of twists  will keep you involved to the last page Extensive bibliography for those  interested  learning more about the theories -- scientific   archaeological -- behind the story
Although I didn't give  5 stars I still enjoyed this book  was  classic Crichton  the sense that like all his books he did some heavy  research into the subject that he writes about  was an entertaining  story but a little too predictable after a while I mean how many times can  the main characters get into near death situations  then find a way out  of their predicaments? this book  happens coutless times Never the  less I had a good time reading this story  have to say that I am already  eagerly awaiting MCrichtons next storyas always
but I found  to be entertaining, no less  Especially enjoyable was the time travel stuff  The knights  fighting armor  their interaction with the 20th century players was fun Just read this book  enjoy  for  what  is then go see the movie  's all entertainment
Written clearly from the perspective of the inevitable action movie that will eventually capture this book TimeLine, at its best, gives you a flavor of the 14th century that entertains   enlightens - a bit  As a  story, there are plot holes so big, you wince  characters so cardboard  you want to scream  &quot;Future artifacts&quot; aren't allowed back   time, yet a professor wears his bifocals  everyone from the future  carries aluminum canisters full of sleeping gas?  Those were around  the  days of knights?  Unrealistically well-timed grenade-blasts  sword-chops  add that flavor of &quot;give me a break, THAT was convenient for the plot  line&quot; that makes this book just plain silly at times   all this  time travel is to create really realistic theme parks  the present?  HellOOO?  Jurrasic Park, anyone? Wait for the paperback, for crying out  loud
Michael Crichton has become a director, a screenwriter, a producer,  a  creator of TV shows, among other endeavors, but he's apparently spreading  himself too thin   I enjoy his writing style (loved &quot;Andromeda  Strain,&quot; &quot;Disclosure,&quot; &quot;Airframe,&quot;  the first  23 of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;), but he seems to be losing his focus   his novels  &quot;Timeline,&quot; like &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; starts  out with an extremely innovative plot  then deteriorates into a series  of chase  rescue scenes (either dinosaurs  knights on horseback)    Crichton is spending less time on character development---you don't really  care what happens to any of these two-dimensional folks   &quot;Timeline&quot;--- more on visualizing how this novel will look on  the silver screen    This is a major talent who needs to concentrate more  on his writing  to give  up for a bit while he pursues other interests   Those of us who buy his books are being cheated by his half-hearted  efforts as a novelist
I can't go into as much detail as I would like, but MC's newest book is a  true masterpiece, I enjoy the differant perspectives  forward looking  philosophies
timeline starts out really stronga page turner there are enough stories happening to keep your interest the end kinda falls apart you know when you go see a movie  you just know they ran out of maney  had to slap  an ending together?  thats how i felt at the end of the book
Timeline is a great adventure book,  the historical view on 14th century France is fascinating but their is just something missing My big problem with the book is why they are going back  Time I don't think  there is a good explanation  the book other than a big company with a lot  of money to spend Second the science behind Time Travel just wasn't  explained well enough  left me with too many questions I say wait for  the Paperback
This book was a roller coaster ride to the end  I could not put  down  The pages seemed to turn themselves  Michael Crichton wins again with a brilliant novel that is thoroughly researched  each detail draws you  further into the story  into the the lives of the characters  I would  recommend this to all types of readers, especially those that enjoy  actionadventure, sci-fi,  suspense  Enjoy as you begin the new  millenium
There is an old saying that instructs writers to &quot;write what you know&quot;  I can think of no author of popular fiction that follows this adage to the degree Crighton does  all his books;  &quot;Timeline&quot; is no exception  I can think of no book I have  recently read that I have enjoyed more  The subject matter is fascinating,  the action relentless  his attention to scientific  historical  accuracy makes  difficult to determine where the real world ends   Crighton begins  More than a book about time travel,  &quot;Timeline&quot; is a book about people of different times  natures   sends the reader plunging through the ether of quantum physics into the  brutal midst of the &quot;100 year war&quot; between medieval England   France  I suggest that before you begin this book you set aside enough  time to finish   one sitting as that is what you will be compelled to  do
Computers can now send people back  time - to a frightening barbaric world where some fit , some die,  some decide to stay Crichton's story of a group of scientists sent on a doomed rescue mission becomes a riveting tale of adjustments  historical confrontations, setting   apart from the usual focus on paradox  making a satisfying, involving  account
An excellent book to read, but seemed a tad too much like he was writting a screenplay instead of a book Definately a quick read as once the book gets going  never lets up
 just didn't have that Crichton Punch
One word sums this novel up Fabulous Up until now my favourite Crichton was The Andromeda Strain That book gave me nightmares Now I have a new favourite Built upon the tried  tested 'Time Travel' plot line I was  pleasantly surprised to find that Timeline was surprisingly realistic   believable I have to hand  to Crichton, I didn't believe he could pull   off After starting with some trepidation I was soon drawn into the  novel  its brilliantly imagined  conveyed plot Talk about a  rollercoaster ride you may want to go back  experience  again,  because this one blows you away!
I advise anyone who likes science fiction  history to read this book I never put the book down, except for at school I think  described the area of Dordogne very well, after seeing a TV show on  The book has a  very magnificant author I loved this book
I found  very hard to become absorbed  this book until the second half  is written  a very choppy, episodic manner--as though the author was imagining the movie that will be made afterward The characters are not  very developed,  I kept mixing up their identities for awhile Like a  mindless Saturday night movie, however, the novel ultimately does  entertain
This book was okbut kind of boring  wasn't all that I thought  would be I liked the beginning  all of the scientific stuff However, I found the running around fighting knights deal boring  redundant  unfortunately, that was the majority of the book
I am an author  I love thrillers My biggest disappointment  today's world of adventure fiction is the inability to find a mesmerizing adventure constructed with poetic  living prose which allows me to feel the  southern Louisiana heat, smell the toasted bagels  a Manhattan deli   wince along with the facial expressions of a lawyer caught ambulance  chasing  the hospital room of a critically injured patient While a  better yarner than Turow, this author's works lack the sort of living color  which fiction demands I recently discovered an author who accomplishes  this  a thriller  which he does  The author is Gary Wickert,   the book is DARK REDEMPTION I didn't find  yet on Barnes &amp; Noble,  but  has just been released   is available on Amazoncom  you  like this author's storylines, but want to be riveted to  made love to  by the prose which are the building blocks of any piece of fictionREAD  'DARK REDEMPTION'
I've read timeline   was killer Non-stop action on the edge of your seat I could not put the book down! Anyone who is into action  sci-fi , This is your book! Trust me! br Happy Reading
I started reading Timeline Friday evening, stayed up until 4:00 am, quickly went through my Saturday chores so that I could immediately get back into the journey Timeline had taken me on!  I stayed home Saturday  night literally going through every event  the story, as  I were a  character,  did not leave this house until I had completed the book   truly was sad to see  end! I was exhausted at the end, feeling like I was  a part of this story On Sunday, I met with friends  discussed this high  energy,  mix of history,  adventure story  we cast the roles for a  hopefully up coming movie! This was a fabulous book  I wanted more!
A terrific book that I hope will becomes a movie Some of the quantum theory was a bit complex, duh, but interesting I found the book exciting  hard to put down The ending was quite a surprise I recommend this  one
I have enjoyed many of his previous books This one has a compelling plot, time-travel, quantum mechanics, 13th century France But Crichton delivers only the bare bones of a novel,  is more a screen-play for an  action-adventure flick starring Leonardo Very unsatisying
A combination of imaginable theory  historical records is never easier However, made such an product recreational  educational is much more difficult I think the author did a quite satisfactory job that only a few  could accomplish br Do you notice any explanation how a historical time  were designated? I didn't find any of  Another interesting thinking is  that do you ever wonder what &quot;historical research&quot; Marek would do   fourteen century England  France,   so, how? Due to his very  unique position  situation  &quot;history&quot;, he may suffer a lots   he want continuing his career as a historical scholar
I really enjoyed Timeline   was a book that just kept on going  I couldn't put  down  I recommend   I think  was Michael Crichton's best book
I have read all of Michael Crichton's books  I must say,  my opinion, this is the best! I read the book  one snowy night whenthe power was off, by flashlight, that is how good  is! The characters take on a life of  their own, I cried at the end, I am not ashamed to say This would make a  great movie (hint, hint) Buy this book, you won't be sorry!
As with some of Crichton's other novels, this one is bearable  you turn off your brain  just visualize the action The quantum theories presented are very young  for the most part, disregarded my most  physicist The most discouraging thing about the story is the gigantic  holes!  is painfully obvious that Chrichton was hoping that readers would  not catch-on to how short the novel would have been   was constructed  with any logic
Crichton certainly does thourough research when preparing to write a novel   seems to me that despite all of his hard work, the final product is always half sci-fi thriller, half Hollywood fluff   Nevertheless,  Timeline is a fun book to read  No philosophical paradoxes  political  manifestos  We want to keep on reading because each page contains a bit of  information we may need later on  Sometimes 's just one sentence   phrase but there is always something there  br Timeline is good  Sphere   Jurassic Park were better  Read   you'll be satisfied  Not blown  away but satisfied
Overall, Timeline excels  the middle of the story   is very good  very fast paced  However, the beginning  the end drag  down  The beginning takes a little too long setting up characters, but not developing  them,  letting us know just how quantam physics works  I don't really  give a damn how the hell they get  the past  I just want to read about  them  the past  The book read like a movie all the way through, but   was also highly detailed  highly scientific  Overall, the middle of the  book was terrific   perfectly describes the way I think of the middle  ages  However, the end is predictable  too neat--tidy  Crichton  tends to wrap everything up  a rather smarmy style, giving everyone their  just-deserves  Overall, the story  writing are solid  However, this  book has a very juvenile ending that completely overcompenstates for its  smart beginning  I'd have been more impressed  Crichton had concentrated  on creating a good ending than a good,  a little slow, beginning
Well, this one was worth a discount rack paperback edition, as far as I'm concerned Unfortunately, I bought the hardcover Anyway, my main problem with the book is that these characters aren't worth  for you to care  about what happens to them  the 14th century What Crichton does do best   this book, however, is what he's always done best: he is able to  describe complicated scientific hypotheses  very clear  very  interesting language The parts of the book that describe how time travel  works  a quantum universe were the most interesting My advice, though, a  re-read of Sphere (one of my favorites) would make for a better book
This is yet another screenplay  hardcover  I liked his earlier work but 's getting hard to make  through his latest efforts  I think the major issue here is the lack of any character development compared to what MC has  demonstrated  the past
The medieval era has never been so interesting I bought the 16 hr version of the audio book  was very skeptical after reading the summary But right from the beginning,  grabbed my interest  curiosity   never let them gobr Another Jurassic Parkimprobable but he makes you  believe  could happen!
Wow, this book was amazing  is a high adrenaline paced adventure that will have you stuck  your seat until the very end I loved the  non stop sword play  suspense Not only does Crichton give you afuturistic,  technology based look into the future,(as always) but he also takesa look  into the past giving the you a rollercoaster of action I loved the cast of  characters  how you saw each one changethroughout the book The only  disapointment tothis novel was the constant build ups of suspenseand then  the disapointment to find out that thenext page was a dull check-up to see  how thepeople  the present time were doing For me,this effect took out a  lot of the suspense andaction  the many dramatic fight scenes locatedin  almost every other chapter  the book However,this book still has plenty  of facts, fun, andaction topped off with what I thought was a decentending
The last Michael Crichton novel I read was The Lost World  coming back to him, I discovered that he is still  top form  The science  the action  the suspense are all here,   you are one of those readers  who can willingly let go of reality for a couple of days then this novel is  great  While not a new concept, time travel becomes something entirely  original  profoud  Crichton's book  traveling back to feudal France  (I could think of a hundred other hackneyed places to go to) makes   distinct from all others  Contrary to others, I think the historical  information is a wonderful addition to the book  The ghosts of camera  angles  stunt coordination  costume design for the inevitable film  are evident  the pages  while this has no deep  meaningful  revelation about the workings of life,  is an enjoyable adventure,  a  category all its own  To me, Timeline was like candy: not nutritious, but  extremely tasteful
I see alot of people have been slamming this book, I don't know why though 's very entertaining  does what a book should do For me that purpose would be to entertain me  make me feel like I was living the  story along with the characters  the book The book did both of these  things  more! Great adventure! Superb characters! An excellent story  line! I could go on but what's the point? Read  yourself!  you're like  me  you just want to read a wicked adventure story you would not go  wrong  choosing this book to read NUFF SAID!
Previous critical reviews have already captured my negative sentiments towards this popular author  seem to follow very similar lines; written for the screen, too many close calls, logical errors, shallow characters,  trite  incomplete treatment of science, unresolved paradoxes, etc  br But one major flaw that I feel has not been addressed is Mr Crichton's  choice of historical period  you ask people what person  history they  would most like to meet  possible, you will find, I'm sure, that Jesus  would have to be at the top of the list Maybe this would be too  controversial a personperiod to have chosen but  would make the most  logical sense from the entrepreneurial aspect of ITC - at least to have  received mention (i e vs A Lincoln) as a possibility to show investors  Another period that was ignored was that of the future, again from the  perspective of what people would desire to know about  be most willing  to pay for br I am always disappointed  romantic arts that are so  blatantly created for market I don't censure Crichton Inc, but greed has  quelled more than a few creative fires
As a huge Michael Crichton fan this is the first book that was a disappointment The beginning was good The technical information  research was interesting as always  Crichtons books The middle held my  attention until the ongoing similar type of fighting  chasing got to be  tedious Enough was enough By the time I got to the end I struggled not to  skip ahead The biggest disapppointment was that this book was definitely  written to be a movie I noticed this from very close to the beginning I  kept seeing the Indiana Jones movie  my head as I read this book As a  faithful reader I look forward to Crichtons next book but would like to see  him get back  touch with his readers  the future, rather than writing  a script for a movie I will hope he writes an authentic novel as were his  novels  the past
Crichton, once again has written a novel which leads one to ponder the truth of the fantastical  this novel, he includes part science fiction, part factual science,  part history With a captivating plot  an  unusual approach to time travel, this book is deffinitely worth reading  The reader will most probably walk away questioning the possibility  of  time travel
After months of tedious work,  mind numbing report writing, I wanted to find a book to just kick back with,  found just the thing  &quot;Timeline&quot;   wasn't difficult to follow, was at times  creative,  was basically fun to read   made for a pleasant two day  vacation from the present world
Michael Crichton's recent midieval novel, TIMELINE, proved to be a far more interesting  engaging story than I had expected from reading the inside cover Crichton has cleverly mixed modern quantom theory with a  little imagination  a lot of interesting facts from a time  place  most of us know little about  produced an action thriller I found I  could not put down!br While the ending was somewhat predictable  the  motivation for the story to occur  the first place was somewhat  questionable you will quickly find yourself caught up  carried along by  this clever story of modern man meeting some rather tough folks from a long  time agobr Treatr yourself to some enjoyable, recreational reading  go  for TIMELINE
I really enjoyed TIMELINE  I was leery buying  because  sounded toooo far fetched  But he did a great job as usual  The quantam theory is rather exciting to consider  I look forward to his next book
I have read all Michael Crichton's works  find him a very diverse author, as this book demonstrates  The historical perspective brings the book alive   was difficult wading through the &quot;quantum&quot;  theories at the beginning of the book, but smooth sailing past that  A  really enjoyable read  I'll bet the movie will be a block buster
When I first saw this book I was excited to see a Crichton book incorporating another highly scientific concept (quantum theory) into an adventure story  As I read I was disappointed  the glib nature of the  action  the book br  seemed that every section was trying to have a  cliff-hanger ending  Like I was watching a made for TV movie right before  a commercial  Also, the actions of the characters didn't make logical  sense  many casesbr Many times I felt like I was back  Jr High  reading a role-playing fantasy book  Not enough depthbr The two things I  did like were 1) the concept  2) the ending   also gave me a layman's  understanding of quantum mechanicsbr When compared to Jurassic Park   some of Crichton's past novels, this one just doesn't cut   Overall, I  think he has seen the money  knows how to write to make a strong movie,  not a strong book
One of very few books that I just couldn't get invloved   The ending is fairly predictable  the book is a chore to read  I think Chrichton is trying to sell movies rather than write good books  Airframe was the last  book I really enjoyed from him
Critchon's gift for weaving physics, quantum theory,  history into a riveting story is unparalleled  I've read all his books,  this one ranks as one of his best  I finished this book  two days, I did not want to put the book down   I also enjoyed the character development of  &quot;Chris,&quot; from a relative weak character who seemed to be the  slowest to adjust to the main characters' situations, to a strong, more  self confident person I recommend to everyone who enjoys reading
Very disappointing  A promising idea but shallow characters, far too many predictable close callsnarrow escapes without tension,  loose threads, made this a big yawn  About 13 of the way through, I started to skip-read to get through the drivel  Some early potential plot directions  were later abruptly dismissed  a couple of sentences for no apparent  reason   feels like Mr Crichton wrote this on a single plane trip (NY  to LA?)  Perhaps on his way to sell the movie rights?
Needless to say I enjoyed this book  While  gave some informative historical perspectives,  also entertained  No doubt a movie is on the &quot;event&quot; horizon for this one There are some aspects that defy  logical reasoning , yes, their could be some character development  However, who cares?  This was a fun 7 hour read  I look forward to the 3  hour movie
I love Chrighton's ability to write action packed fiction to a technical geek like me Timeline was thrilling,  included a brilliant vision of not-too-distant future technologies (insightful si-fi) as well as life  the 1300's (historical fiction) I couldn't put  down  can't wait for  the movie which will undoubtedly follow)br After I finished I reflected  that Timeline is a direct copy of the Jurrasic Park formula:      - an  early tease of technical problems   - a group of unsuspecting youths   - a  misunderstood, ancient world   - numerous violent threats   - a technical  genius with his incredible computing power   - a plan to make a fortune  while ignoring obvious moral dilemas br Which book am I refering to? Both
After being hooked on Jurassic Park  its sequel the Lost World, I was quite disappointed with Airframe, Crichton's 1997 effort  Timeline has the exciting plot that I felt Airframe sadly lacked,  from start to finish   grips you incessantly  The quantum theory relating to travel  the  'multiverse' grabs your attention early on  forces you to engage your  brain  a critical but also receptive manner  The setting is suberb - the  Dordogne  the south of France is a beautiful area rich  medieval  history  Also, the constant switching between the 14th  the 20th  centuries is very effective  At times you can imagine how easily the  scenes could be transformed into film, but this is no bad thing - a  well-made screen version of this story would be a great  experiencebr Hopefully Crichton will not, however, feel compelled to write  a third instalment of the Jurassic Park story  I personally thought the  events should have been concluded with the first book, but the Lost World  (novel) was still far superior to the film version  An extension to the  story, potentially involving dinosaurs running amock on the mainland ( a  similar vein to the ludicrous scenes at the end of the second film) would  be very difficult to stomach  However, a prequel to the first book would  be far more palatable
Timeline is a return to the well-researched, carefully explained, writing style of Jurassic Park, unlike the topic-worn-thin trailer novel Lost World  An archaelogical team working on a medieval castle site  France are sent back  time to rescue their team leader who has been floated back  into time on &quot;quantam foam,&quot; residue from the big bang creation  of the universe  The meglamaniacal CEO of ITC Industries is planning to  use the technology to send wealthy tourists back to the past for  &quot;authentic&quot; entertainment  Never mind the problems with messing  with the past that might erase  alter the future, &quot;The Past is the  Future&quot; for ITC  br Plenty of blood  gore, along with Crichton's  careful explanation of quantam physics  possible glitches to boot make  this an interesting novel for those who like to think about new things   Still, the plot is predictable  the theme park run by an eccentric  multimillionaire has regular Crichton readers waiting for something  entirely new  fresh  br Not a bad read, but not Crichton's greatest  either Look for the movie at a theater near you
Timeline's 444 pages flew by  a little over 1 12 days!  I have read all of Crichton's books  would consider this to be among the best   you've always been fascinated by the prospect of time travel,  are  interested  learning a little mid evil history, this is the way to go   Definitly one of those books which I would have been happy to keep reading   am a little saddened to have finished so quickly
This was a great book by Michael Crichton  was full of action  adventure  I think everyone should read this book  mixes The 20th century With the 14th century  its a real page turnerI  couldn't put  this book down This is why I think this book deserves five stars
I must say, that Timeline was very different   was not what I was hoping for, but  was still a fun book to read  I thought that  was a neat premice, but the way he wrote  did not fit the story   was still  enjoyable,  I liked  a lot
As a fan of both Crichton  historical fiction, I found this book very disappointing That's not to say that I didn't enjoy  Timeline is fast-paced  contains plenty of made-for-Hollywood  computer games  violence  scenarios The character development is minimal, however,   will require the assistance of some very talented actors to make Crichton's  two-dimensional figures come to lifebr The historical reconstruction is  equally shallow, with all events taking place  a theme-park medieval  France devoid of all but bloodthirsty knights, fair (but appropriately  feminist) maidens,  pious monks Crichton's previous attempts at  historical reconstruction (Eaters of the Dead, The Great Train Robbery)  were more successful His failure here results  a book that kept me  turning the pages as much out of mirth as from suspensebr I can't wait for  the movie!
As I read Crichton's latest novel, I couldn't help but have a sense of deja vu Hmmmwhere have I heard this story before? I know!   a CHILDREN'S BOOK! Ever read &quot;How I Faced the Hampshire Mauler&quot; from Max  Me  the Time Machine by Gery Greer  Bob Ruddick? Well,  the jousting tournament,the knight dressed  black  even the sensations  felt by the characters while being transported are strikingly similar I  looked forward to Timeline with great anticipation, but was truly  disappointed that Crichton saw fit to develop nothing more than a brutal,  disgusting, head-lopping chase scene instead of his characters Crummy plot   shallow charactersjust the right ingredients for a mainstream cinema  hit Crichton really seems to have opted  favor of writing fodder for  Hollywood; too bad any quality is nonexistent
This scenario was painted by L Sprague DeCamp  Fletcher Pratt  the Incomplete Enchanter  Castles of Iron years ago Not an original idea  setting Only the quantum time machine is new I thought the book was  tedious
's not as great as the early crichton novels, but  ranks  the top 5  After reading  i felt wow what  this really happen  made me think about  for days   you like the idea of time travel  middle ages,  this is the book to read  Just like all the other crichton novels I LOVED  !
This is the first Crichton book I have read,   may just be the last  The plotlines  this are so obvious from the beginning  Some of the tech stuff is fairly interesting, but there are so many holes  the plot that   ruins the entire book  Crichton needed to think some of his theories  through a bit more before he put them  print  Although he tries to make  a true represtentation of the past, he throws some fantasy  there with  the seven foot insane giant  'transcription' errors that don't make any  sense
When I picked up Timeline at the local bookseller I expected the same &quot;Crichtonesk&quot; mannor of a novel  What I found  Timeline was much more  This book will make you think, which I enjoy  Starting off  with theories of quantum foam  a multiverse was deffinitly an attention  getter  Then combining clever characters with a 14th century plot,  amazing  About half of the book actually takes place  the Middle Ages   This section of the book is definitly not light hearted  The fast pased  action  adventure vividly portrays the Medevil period, also combining  the unique twist with the four twentieth century adventures  All  all I  would have to say that  is definitly one of Crichton's best yet! Can't  wait for the next
This story seriously lacks character development   becomes even more sketchy when the protagonists travel back  time  However, as the outline for a movie  is sufficient  The action alone will carry the movie   Suffice  to say,  isn't enough to sustain the story  After reading ,  I couldn't help but think &quot;who were these people,  who cares?&quot;   You'll be better served  you wait for the movie, rather than being  disappointed by this story
On the brither side I finished Timeline , to say the least,  was exciting  However, even though  was very exciting, the characters were typically shallow, cardboards nobodies  The medieval period was portrayed  at first as a very different palce than had been expected by the historians  but that only lastyed a few seconds After a bit  devolved into the same   meldramatic nonsense that they were cranking out  the days of  Erol  Flynnbr The medieval period was very complicated  the personalities    were equally complex Knights were seldom the mindless killers that they  are made out to be  Ceremony  ritual had deep routes  were not  window dressing  The level of piety, by our standards, was extremely high,  even by those nasty knightsbr The author seemed to want  both ways  He  wanted authenticity of culture but not the real emotion that brought that  culture about  Again the religous aspect of the book was downplayed into  near oblivion, where as  real medieval Europe, particularly  the 14th  century, Religious issues dominated politics, social life,   warfarebr He did bring up some interesting points The fact that nobody  really knows what the inside of a 14th centruy castle looked like   the  fact that people bathed more often than we want to admit they did  Yet all  these things do is make me mad that the authior didn't follow through on  his apparent desire to show the medieval period for what  wasbr His  knights were evil  the manner of  Freddy from nightmere on elm street   Darth Vader, for all his cardboard nature, is a far deeper character than  any of the villains of this story  The only character that was believable  was the Lady Claire  All the rest, moderns included, were stockbr As far  as the science involved, puke!   sucks  First of all the idea of quantum  foam is cool  But the author trys, stupidly, to make quantum foam out to  be this bubbly stuff on the floor of the lab, instead of what  really is,  which is part of every atom  all directions  We are, right now, moving  through  quantum foam, we are made up of    may be the reason we have  TIME  We may be, at this momment, transsioning through countless universes  like a moive where each frame is multidemensional yet static  I guess I  wish I didn't know as much about quantum foam so that I could be awed by  the concept of traveling through  like the dudes  Fantastic Voyage   But since I have seen  done before,  that movie for a matter of fact,   was not very exciting  originalbr Critten falls again  again, into  the worst trap of science fiction; the trap of technology  The best sci-fi  books I have ever read have little to do with technology  When you try   base your story on an emerging technology you better get  right  you  are going to look like a dufus  The best advice is to keeps things as  vague as you can get away with  A matter transporter is just that,   needs no explanation as to how  works  Therein lies the trap for no  matter what you say your going to get  wrong  you will instantly date  your story  Critten falls into this trap big time But I am not going to  let him off the hook  He attemtps to tell us how the machine works to get  people back  time but fails to tell us anything aobut how they are able  to accurately pinpoint the exact time the traveler is going to , since  you are dealing with quantum foam, the answer to that question is that you  can't  Because on that level there is only uncertainty, nothing can be  accurately predicted Certainly not navigating a traveler to a specific  universe  a specific time  that universebr  the contrivences of  convinience made me a little sick too  The big glass?  tanks to shield the  transit booths from stray rays?  Why glass? Oh yeah, so they can  conviniently break when things explode   the silly babble-fish  ear-peice that can translate middle french  english on the fly  Nothing  like a computer that can translate  multiple dead languages that have no  written dictionay so nobody knows exactly all the words used  them   Remember we base our knowledge of these languages on a pitifful few  manuscripts compiled by a very narrow segment of the populationbr Swords:   Yes they were heavy but unlike the ones  the story, they were expertly  balanced so that they could be wielded with only moderate effortbr War:   Yes things sucked pretty bad  the year 1357  But most battles did not  happen at castles They were hardly ever attacked  As Critten accurately  noted  the book, a siege took too much time  A free company wanted quick  loot  But  a castle was attacked the attacker almost without acception,  layed a long term seige that could last six weeks  six months  Look at  Harflur, the king of England seiged that town for months before  fell   the seige cost Henry V half his men to disease  The seigfe cost more  lives than the battle of Agincourt! At that was a town!  Big castles, built  high on rocky outcrops didn't usually get attackedbr Court: Feudalism was  almsot totally overlooked  the book  The relationship between Oliver   his knights would have played a much larger role  the book  the reality  of feudalism had been incorporatedbr Jousts:  The typical medieval  trournament took weeks  there was little excitment for the masses   There was,  anything, even more cerimony  ritual here  Knights fought  with squared off swords  lances that, again were expertly balanced   Tournament armor was also different than combat armor   was a money  making endeavour for the lord who held ,  He didn't really benifit from  having a knight get killed   most knights didn't want to get killed   a joust   was a violent sport for sure, but not a leathal sport  High  nobbles put a heavy penelty for knights who got out of hand  killed  their opponent  That was a no no punishable by death?  No just a steep  fine That brings up another point that could have been made  that is  that medieval justice on average was mainly delt out by way of stiff fines   confiscations, not torture  deathbr Time paradoxes:  not totally  glossed over  is almost tottally glossed over  The CEO's explanation  that one man could not change history sucks  But I guess  the book  is  true Yet look at the last scene at Eltham Castlebr Best part of the  book: The very beginning  the very end  I was touched by the final  scene at the castle of Eltham  That was how the whole book should have  been
read   you like that kind of thing but not because 's a best seller
Crichton is one of my favorite authors,  I had high hopes for this one- how could you go wrong combining Crichton  medievil warfare?  The book started off well, but soon became quite boring  With a large opportunity  for great action, he fails to keep us  suspence for very long,  the  bumps  the character's roads become quite predictable   you haven't  read Sphere, check that one out instead
There are few books  the market that take you to the worlds that Michael Crichton does He effortlessly makes you believe that his imaginary world can actually exist This book is one of his most unique works
Admittedly its been many years, but does anyone agree that this is Twain's classic set  the high tech age?br Good start; great promise; reduced to a fast paced but non-spellbinding revisit to Medieval Times  br Such a  premise had such promise!  Oh Well, everyone is allowed one disappointment!
I started this book hoping for a mixture of Jurassic Park  Pillars of the Earth  found a little of each but not enough of both  was a good read - Crichton's science foundation  an interesting scenario made  a  page turner, particularly the middle third I had no trouble with the plot   reasoning here; this is fiction of course I agree with other reviewers  that the characters were flat  needed more development The constant  escape-flee-recapture scenes the characters went through got tiring   anything, the book needed more pages to better describe  reveal the  historic world they visited All  all, however I enjoyed the book   recommend  One note on the time traveling paradox With infinite  parallel universes, the fear on unduly influencing the future would be  moot
's no coincidence that, according to amazon's index, the people who are reading Timeline are also reading Grisham  Clancy All three are remarkable researchers who re-imagine technical systems -- genetic engineering  quantum physics (Crichton), the law (Grisham)  the  postmodern military (Clancy)as detailed but breezy narratives that give the  sense of massive complexity without ever making you seriously engage your  forebrain Key characters get the same free pass: Bright grad students,  novice lawyers  rank--file GIs invariably end up bailing out highly  trained specialists when the going gets tough  these books    That's to  be expected  genre fiction, but  places constraints on such novels that  can't be glossed over Most important is the utter failure of the  characters  these books to rise above predictable, one-dimensional  status    Timeline's characters are a case  point They are not  representations of people; they are allegorical figures with arms  legs   is impossible to care about them  to be surprised by them  any but  the most vague  sentimental way    Timeline manages to defer such  problems for much of its length by ushering us through a fascinating series  of time-travel conundrums, a detailed immersion into medieval life   climactic battle scenes that borrow from both epic lore  medieval  romances such as Sir Gawain  the Green Knight -- though  the latter  case the references are too hamfisted to engage real students of the era     But by the last third of the book, the seams are showing badly Key  secondary characters are positioned  then forgotten; new ones are pushed  onstage to take their place; main players step totally out of character At  one point a fiercely independent young feminist responds to a life-saving  act by a previously weak colleague by cooing -- I kid you not -- &quot;My  hero&quot; 's hard to imagine a real timeline that takes us from here to  that silly moment -- even via the alchemy of quantum physics
While the book is written  a more complex, detailed style,  reminds me of several Star Trek concepts:  Time  space travel; trying to fit  with persons from another era  There is even a discussion of Star Trek's  Prime Directive not to interfere with other worlds  to affect their  history, although Crichton does not mention Star Trek  I wish the book had  been more original
Of course, the &quot;time machine&quot; concept is always intriguing, but the execution here leaves much to be desired  Hard to believe this book is on the best-seller list
Timeline kept my interest from beginning to end - I almost thought I understood quantum mechanics, but alas - I don't  Nevertheless, a fast-paced book that kept me turning pages, a very interesting premise,  characters you will care about  I can't wait for the movie - I'm sure  there will be one!
A real page turner, but tiresome after awhile  Heroes always have a quick, convenient way out  Reader begins not to worry, since  less than a page, the obstacle is overcome,  a new one presentedagain,   again,  again
This book was more action-oriented than I'd like, but the plot  sciencescience fiction were enough to keep me interested br Toward the end of the book, I found one comment to be as insightful as  is ironic:  Crichton notes that  our modern society, the culture's supreme ideal is  entertainment  permeates everything -- from politics to education,   everything  between This, from he who has mastered  exploited this  penchant of ours
Having read a number of Chrichton's books, from Jurassic Park to Eaters of the Dead, I have to say that ,though not his worst, this was deffinetly not his best He appeared to be rushing through many portions of the book which  could have used much more detail, such as the town one of the characters  runs through, the tournament he competes   the dungeon he is  imprisoned  I hope Chrichton has not exhausted his repetoire of  immaginative yarns, as this novel had much to ask for Even with the lack  of detail,  is however, a great tale with a very orriginal ending allong  the lines of the original printing of JP  Hammonds demise
By Crichton's standard's, poorly written He must have had tons of help doing the research,  there were parts of the book that were so bad I swore he must have had help with the writing, too No character  development, far too many narrow escapes Far too many hacked-off limbs,  flaming heads  arrows  the eye About 100 pages too long On the plus  side, very interesting popularization  about how quantum theory may be  applied some day,  the attention to detail about 14th century France was  excellent Too bad the writing was so shallow
While  took me a while to get into the book, I thought  very entertaining The  character development was sketchy, but by the end of the book, I was hoping for a sequel featuring Marek I sometimes found the  skipping from present to past a little confusing While not the best book  from this author, I would still recommend 
I found Timeline to be an interesting read However, there were several chapters that could have been omitted  the book still would have flowed well For those of us who enjoy reading period pieces, Timeline does  deliver
I've only read a few Crichton books  I would'nt have bought this one, but  was given to me as a gift, so I felt obligated to read   's about half interesting  I think  drags on too much when the characters  are  the past  Medieval France While  the past the characters  survive way too many close calls, ie drownings, falling off cliffs,  falling out of castle windows, a close encounter with a beheading, etc   Not even cats have that many lives  Okay, 's fantasy, but its goofy  fantasy  The author does have a great skill at writing  makes   easy  to  envision the sights  sense of the period  the past  I enjoyed the  character of Doniger as CEO of a nasty mega-corporation  But is anybody  really that ruthless  evil  Okay, maybe Hitler!  I guess  you're a  Crichton fan this book will be another good read  I thought  dragged  when the story was  the past  I'm glad I stayed with , but I'm glad to  finally be done reading !
I enjoyed the premise  the rich scientific detail describing quantum foam wormholes  I also liked the vivid descriptions of 1350s France  Lots of action People who enjoy this topic would also like Clifford Pickover's  book &quot;Time: A Traveler's Guide,&quot; a book that is part science,  part fiction  (The characters  Pickover's book use a huge rotating  cylinder  space to go back to the time of Chopin)
My least Favorite Cricton book (except maybe Congo) Too much roller-coaster action for Medieval France, much of  was uneeded  detracted from the story I prefer a character-driven story I enjoyed the  events  Modern times much more than the past stuff The science was  interestingbr I guess he envisioned Spielberg Directing this  &quot;Movie&quot;  the manner of &quot;Back to the Future 2&quot;   &quot;Indiana Jones 2&quot; I see roles for Leonardo DiCapprio's  maybe  Arnold  I was hoping to read a book
I really enjoyed this book  All of Crichton's books appeal to me because they blend the science  the story so well together  This one did not dissapoint, hopefully  wont be too long until we get a new book!
Crichton has succeeded  defining an entirely new genre of literature -- Techno Historical Fiction  Timeline, as  his previous novels, he has blended the best of history  high-technology to create a plausible  timeline for our future His ability to create a vision of the possible  course of our future is stunning, but his talent for communicating to the  non-technical audience is what makes  seem so real He has again  succeeded  the transfer of knowledge to the masses,  that is what  gives us hope  moves us forward as a society Imagine learning about  quantum physics  actually enjoying ,  you'll understand the essence  of Timeline
I didn't realize that I was disappointed with Michael Crichton's latest effort until I approached the end of the book  At that point, I could predict nearly every turn of the page  Like Lost World, the book has a  strong entrance with wonderful scientific speculation that causes you to  periodically put the book down  race to your encylopedia for a primer on  quantum physics  medieval history  Unfortunately, the book tails off at  the end  eventually thuds to an abrupt halt  Nonetheless, I will read   enjoy everything Mr Crichton writes  reassure myself that better  stuff is yet to come
 has an interesting premise  seems well researched, but this novel was clearly intended as a screenplay  Fun, but perhaps we should wait for the movie
This is his most thrilling book  years!  Fans will appreciate this one  The master does the job once again!
Written to be made into a movie very obviously  Twice the ridiculous escapes as even TITANIC had
This book is great I have a hard time putting  down  will probably finish  within 3 days Unfortunately there are quite a few historical flaws   making  a typical american view of medieval europe I dont't  think he could do any different however A certain literary freedom was  necessary to make some of the passages work
Was very disappointed  TimeLinebook needed editing, first 150 pages could have been cut by half  all the 'saids' removed to save a treebr Characters were flat  a reader couldn't really care about them;   feel the suspensebr TV's Sliders was more thrilling!
Wait for the movie  There won't need to be a screenplay  This is 
This was the best book by Michael Crichton that I have read   I think I have read them all   was entertaining  informative  the story was easy to follow, yet complicated  just the right ways  The  time-travel theory was fastenating to me  I found myself wondering  br  the ending could have gone  many different ways  Being one  who gets really annoyed when an excellent book ends badly, I was truely  satisfied  delighted with the way Mr Crichton ended this one  I am  already looking forward to his next book
Look the truth is that  is just Jurassic Park with time travel butso what  The fact of the matter is that this still is a good book   is a little on the predictable side, i'll concede that but the vivid description  of the time more than makes up for   The only character I really got  attached to was Marek  The others seemed to float   out  seemed  unimportant  One gripe I did have is that the charcters had more lives  than a cat  As soon as you think one of them is finally dead, heshe pops  back up again  None the less I could not put this book down  But wait for  paperback
Time travel has always fascinated me, that's why I jumped a t the chance to buy this book Imagine a time travel by Micheal Crichton!   I found that his time travel method (this is fiction, of course) was plausible   well thought out  Also, his research on medieval matters was impressive   BUT the story  itself was weak  the characters neglected  Those  should be the main attraction for the reader,  they  were not  At least  not for me   was a very ambitious book by Crighton  maybe too  ambitious for only 500 pages
I usually like Michael Crighten, but this book is a rehash of some of his old story lines   is like he rewrote Jurassic Park, with a time travel themebr Smart, arrogant protagonist  Poor dupes as secondary players   Stuff goes wrong, way wrong  Tedious actionbr My biggest gripe about this  book is that the characterization was not very good  I didn't get to know  the characters, all I did was see them go through a number of meaningless  terrible events  But I didn't care because he didn't bring me into their  world  I didn't feel like I really knew any of these characters except on  a very superficial levelbr Take my advice  Reread Andromeda Strain  instead
Not one of Crichton's better efforts This is a really good story of time travel, but  isn't well handled Suspense is weak; deus ex machinas seem to abound, especially  the last third of the book,   reads as    were hurriedly written, with too little attention devoted to resolving plot  elements Connie Willis' Doomsday Book, a similar story, is vastly superior    every respect
I enjoyed reading &quot;Timeline&quot; as I have all of Mr Crichton's books  However, I felt that this particular story was done as effectively  more poignantly  Connie Willis' &quot;Doomsday Book&quot; written   1993
I FELT AS  I WAS TRANSPORTED BACK TO &quot;HUNDRED YEARS WAR&quot; THE TWENTIETH CENTURY TEAM THAT IS SENT BACK IS OVERWHELMED RIGHT FROM THE OUTSET  THEN THE GOING REALLY GETS TOUGH I FINISHED THIS BOOK  ONE  SITTING  I'M NOT A BIG CRIGHTON FAN ONE CANNOT HELP BUT WONDER &quot;  THE TECHNOLOGY EXISTS WILL WE MORAALY  ETHICALLY BE ABLE TO USE   STRICTLY FOR EDUCATION?&quot; BEING A HISTORIAN MY ANSWER IS A RESOUNDING  &quot;NO WAY&quot;
I enjoyed this book but had a hard time with the scientific stuff  I'm not a scientist  enjoyed his explanation of &quot;How&quot;  could happen but a short explanation is quite enough  Fascinating characters as  well as setting!
I don't know about all of you who only gave the book timeline two to three stars  This book presented many advanced ideas that helped to make the theory of inter-universal time travel believable  Timeline is a must read, not only for 's historical depictions, but also for 's spellbinding story   left  me extremely fulfilled  Keep Reading
I haven't read a Crichton novel  a few years, but this one caught my eye  To call  a page turner would be an understatement  I actually found myself struggling to finish this book during a recent power outage  before the sun went down  I needed to find out how  ended!     I enjoyed  this book very much  I liked the time travelmultiverse aspect  thought  that  was as well thought out as anything Crichton has put to paper  The  action was breakneck  the suspense was good  All  all, another good  one from Michael Crichton
 sure was fun to read Jurassic Park again  Obviously, Crichton believes  not messing with a good thing  Simply take Jurassic Park, substitute time travel for cloning,  substitute knights for dinosaurs,  you have  Timeline  br 's still an enjoyable read  Few authors are better at  mixing cutting edge science  adventure than Crichton  Timeline displays  all the \\"cool\\" ideas  excellent research that he is known for  Still,  's a little disappointing to see that no new ground is broken  this  book  The characters are very forgettable  the situations they  which  they find themselves are a little outlandish  One can only hope that  Crichton's future books show as much innovation  plot   characterization as is shown  the story's science
I remember being a bit hesitant at the thought of beginning such a long  complex book But as soon as I got into , the pages just flew by The plot is very interesting (though I must admit that I found the sientific  aspect a bit confusing) but I still managed to understand the story without  understanding how time travel &quot;works&quot;      To sum  up,  Timeline is by far the best book I have ever read  I would recommend   to anybody
Timeline is awful, the usual blend of cardboard characters  page eating paragraph  short chapter techniquesbr The attempts at creating tension are laughable   Crichton ever does something unpredictable he might  achieve a little tension  But since he does not, you know what's going to  happen before  happensbr I bit on this one after reading a review  the  New York Times Book Review  Having read Timeline  compared my  impression with the reviewer's I can only conclude the fix is  --  somewhere there's money changing handsbr Timeline is tired  stiff,   deserves one behind the earbr I confess I tried  to see  Crichton had  improved since Airframe  He has not,  now joins Robin Cook on my list  of writers still dining out on their first bookbr Readers of the world,  rise up!  Cast off your chains  demand a good story  characters you  care about, not this swill written by a band of monkeys
Timeline was a tremedous ride,  a rush from beginning to end  He's amazing at combining two seemingly unrelated things (Quantum Physics &amp; 14th Century France) into an adventure that I won't soon forget, I highly  recommened this to everyone!
Michael Crichton begins with a solid foundation for yet another thrilling novel, but unfortunately trips himself up along the waybr The idea of time travel, while interesting  key to this story, isn't made strong enough  to believe  even explained enough to completely comprehend  The reader  is left with too many questions regarding its validity, even for a fiction  book, which therefore takes away from the rest of the talebr  the rest  of the tale grows thin as well  The surprisingly lacking character  development never creates a well-rounded cast  allows for predictable  outcomes  Certain sequences seem extremely unlikely dispite the fantasy  aspect of the story  Crichton seemed to force the drama  some passages,  creating the cheesy scenes Hollywood is most likely to scoop up  The  reader soon begins to pray for a quick conclusion to the book instead of  hope for morebr Though well written, Crichton's latest novel is far from  the norm
Before going any further, I gave Timeline four stars for approximately the last third of the book  Michael Crichton seems to always tick me off everytime I read one his novels, mainly because I start off thinking I'm  going to hate   then I have to admit at the end that I enjoyed    You have to give the guy a lot of credit  He certainly knows a good deal  about his material  's aggravating because he takes so damn long to get  going, but when he does you can't put  downbr One of the things that I  find so appealing about Michael Crichton is that he takes very specific   current events  the scientific world  blends them with,  this case,  very specific historical events that are clearly researched  throroughly  presented  Regardless of what you may have thought of Jurassic Park, the  same formula applied there too  Where Jurassic Park was about genetics,  Timeline is about quantum physics  However, by the time all the requisite  scientific set-up  explanation is out of the way, you're itching for the  actual plot to start moving  Fortunately, that's always when   doesbr The thrust of the story is very well done  the combination of  modern technology  medieval warfare works great  As with most of his  books, the action  sequence of events are where Michael Crichton shines  the most  I would be shocked beyond belief  this book did not become a  film  I think  is too his credit that most of Crichton's books become  films because he writes  such a descriptive  visual waybr The main  problems with Timeline are not inconsiderable  Characters are introduced   the first few chapters who are purely for exposition  never appear  again, yet we learn a great deal about them which leads me to suspect they  are a set-up for a possible sequel  Other characters who are critical to  the plot are not really developed, although one could make an argument that  all Michael Crichton characters are secondary to the plot  Lastly, there  are major plot developments which are crucial to the overall suspense of  the story,  yet they are so blatantly foreshadowed that the attentive  reader can see them coming from several dozen pages beforebr I have the  good fortune to share a mutual acquaintance with Michael Crichton  I met  him several years ago when Disclosure was first released  He's an  incredibly nice guy  perhaps one of the most intelligent writers working  today  I just wish that he would be a little more careful  come to the  realization that not all of us are hardcore scientists  I will say that I  read Timeline  2 days , once I got past a certain point, could not put   down until I was finished  Judge for yourself
I still don't understand why Michael Crichton is not considered a Science Fiction author ( he is one of the best  the genre) This is one of his best SF, together with The Andromeda Strain  Jurassic Park Again, he  plays with the consequences  the dangers of new technology The  introduction to the novel is very interesting for those interested  hard  SFbr The way he plays around with quantum mechanics is also very  interesting,  how human beings are faxed through quantum foam wormholes  is very clever Another plus is the Medieval scenario, which Crichton  describes  very rich detail No doubt he did his homework For a hard  science fiction novel, however, the action  mishappenings that take  place to the time travelers  the XIV century are quite unbelivable, to  the point  seems a kid's tale ( better yet, the script for an action PG  movie) So, you have to be patient to see how the story  endsbr Nevertheless, this is one of the best time travel novels I ever  read, as good as Gregory Benford's Timescape (1980 Nebula Award winner)  Both novels have  common that they don't use a magical device, but play  with  extrapole on hard science concepts to explain how time travel is  possible  you enjoy Jurassic Park  Timescape,   your are a fan of  hard SF, this book is for you I strongly recommend br Parents, one  warning: the XIV century scenario is too bloddy for young kidser You  better wait for the movie(you bet there is going to be one) Let's hope the  movie is not too childish, as they did with Jurassic Park  the Lost  World
Orson Scott Card's &quot;PastWatch&quot;  my opinion but a very good read nonetheless Definitely written with a movie  mind - lots of set-piece scenes, movie-style opening chapter etcbr A good book, but I  like others find the story a little contradictory The story asserts that  the characters are not travelling through time per se; rather they are  moving through the multiverse to other parallel universes This being the  case, how is  that the Professor can leave documents for his students to  find  the 'future' - very oddbr Well worth reading though - very  entertaining I still rate Card's book as being a better story though
This was a phenomenal book - could NOT put  down!   took me 14 straight hours to complete &amp;  was worth every minute  Looking forward to the next Michael Crichton book
THis was a great book, one of Chrichton's best, however the pages were uneven  really affected my view of the book,  u don't mind a book  mediocre print, buy , otherwise don't
One of Michael Crichton's strong points is taking a seemingly ridiculous idea (ie, bringing dinosaurs back to life) yet making you believe that that idea is somehow feasible  Crichton fails to do that  this book    Timeline, I looked forward to a good explanation of how time travel might  be possible  Instead, Crichton gives us a mess of incredibly confusing  scientific jargon; which, I expect, he assumed readers would quickly read  through  order to get to the action  This would ordinarily not be such a  bad thing--  the action was riveting
This book is well written  The book keeps the reader riveted to the page,  provides some facts about history  how scientist  historians discover what happened  the early centuries  The book provides an  excellent exposition of the main characters so that the reader knows them  intimately before the story propels the reader  these characters into a  time  the ancient past  As the reader turns the page which ticks off  each hour, minute,  second that the main characters are back  time who  are constantly thwarted  their attempts to regroup  return to the  present, the reader contemplates how the characters will make  back to  the present  time, before they are confined to the past forever
I am a Crichton addict, I admit  Since being forced to read The Andromeda Strain  high school, I've been hooked  Once again Dr Crichton takes us where most folks don't believe we can go  Three years after &quot;Jurrasic  Park&quot;, we get Dolly the sheep  One year after &quot;Airframe&quot;, a  plane suffers extreme turbulance due to a problem with the slats,  's  videotaped by a passenger  How far are we from teleportation?  As usual  for Chriton, the science of the book is well researched, believable,   not too far off  The author's characters are so real, just ever so  slightly imperfect,  usually so blind to their surroundings that they  remind me more of my neighbors than of figments of someone's imagination   The story starts very fast with interesting characters that, unfortunatly,  disappear too quickly  The book's villian, ( our timeline) is too cliche   at times cartoonish  The protagonists of this novel are its stong  point  Usually the villain makes the story but  this book I empathized  so much with the kids that I easily imagined myself there with them  14th  century France  There is a subtle  disturbing moment just after the  first action sequence when one of our heros, the only one that seems to  know what to do  the kid's only hope for survival, witnesses a  tournament practice  realizes how  over their heads they really are   I could see, smell,  hear what the author wanted me to  The action  sequences ( there were some good ones) were well explained  not  overdone  The first two acts of the book are very interesting but tend to  read just a little bit like a history text  There seems to be just enough  action to keep the reader interested  the characters  not the story   However, by the third act the tension builds almost subliminally until you  find yourself on the edge of your seat  Overall I liked  &quot;Timeline&quot; very much, which is to say I didn't love  as much as  some of his other books  Had  not been for the cartoon villian  some  untied loose ends at the very beginning, I would rate the book a solid five  stars  As  stands &quot;Timeline&quot; is still a good, fast paced read    you haven't read Crichton before, just browse the author  Amazon   pick a book, any book  I guarantee you will love   I would recommend to  other loyal Crichton readers to wait for the paperback version of this one
Throughout his writing career Michael Crichton has been charactorized by his excellent use of technological fact This knowledge was than compiled to make a book that could really get the heart pounding Timeline failed to  do that While the story was excellent, the suspense was not there Sadly,  I finished this book a bit dissapointed
This was a very exciting book A real nail biter to the end Unfortunately,  took over 100 pages to get started, but Crichton is such a good writer  didn't matter to much I found myself gasping  throwing  up my hands every time the historians got into another situation  kept  me on the edge of my chair,  I agreed with the ending
As a student of French literature, I enjoyed reading _Timeline_ for the vast amount of French history that is described  I also enjoyed the book for its combination of very modern technology  accurate historical  depictions
I enjoyed this book a great deal  Time travel was a huge interets 20 years ago when I was growing up,  to see  handled this way with todays sense of impending technological advancement was facinating  What ever the  book lacked  originality  more than made up for   details   intrigue  This is a great book for anyone interested  escaping into a  world not so foreign as  is startling  A great read!
Crichton's latest effort, Timeline, once again demonstrates why he deserves a round of applause  By carefully crafting his words, he is able to easily explain the most complex issues of quantum mechanics   eloquently intertwine his words with a stroy line that is flat out  riveting  This book is a sure fire winner
The book starts with a neat premise of harvesting the power of quantum mechanics but quickly betrays the reader by not explaining time-travel paradoxes  not resolving major plot threads One series of events   characters that seem to be essential to the plot are simply never mentioned  again as the book decays into page after page of sword fighting  12th  century France Whenever a sci fi writer ventures into a story about  time-travel,  is his duty to work out the paradoxes  some way (what   you go back  time  kill your grandfather?,  time travel is possible,  why haven't we been over-run with travelers from the future?) Here this is  done by a character literally announcing, &quot;there are no  paradoxes&quot;    is explained that there are an infinite number of  universes with time travelers are going to a different universe that is  almost identical to our own  Strangely, they are able to leave notes   the 'past' that get read by people  the original universe   Summary:    you want a great time travel book, read either  The Doomsday Book  To Say  Nothing of the Dog by Connie Willis
I enjoyed this book a great deal   is not Crichton's best, but  is typical for him  I enjoyed learning from a historical perspective how truly barbaric things were during the 100 years war  Thank goodness we  have moved on  The premise of the book is a bit farfetched, but  you can  enjoy the book for what  is -- good fiction -- I recommend you read 
Mr Crichton's newest novel Timeline is very good  I was instantly taken by all of the ideas thrown out by Mr Crichton  There was mention of quantum physics  its relation to cutting edge technology  Old languages  such as middle english  occitan spoken by a member of the core  characters  Time travel, swordplay, torture methods (no, I am not  sadistic), immersive history,  Bill Gates under an alias  I was excited  to tear through   I did just that, tore through   While all of the  ideas were mentioned, none of them were developed  used very much  While  I was used to a lack of character development by Mr Crichton, this lack of  idea development was extremely disappointing  I give  four stars on the  basis of  having the interesting ideas  being a good thriller
Like most of Crichton's books, I found Timeline to be a fast-paced, entertaining, exciting adventure story that left me feeling exhilarated, along with giving the sense that I'd learned something about medieval  history  Each time I finished a chapter, I wanted to find out what  happened next, which is pretty much my definition of compelling   reads  like 'll make a great movie, but  makes a pretty good book, too
Timeline started out well--a group of academics are sent back to France  the Middle Ages  must survive until they are returned to the present--but  quickly became boring  tedious to read  Page after  page, the characters were constantly fighting for their lives as they  encountered a ridiculous number of contrived mishaps, accidents,   villains  After surviving so many deadly situations, you knew they were  going to be alright  return to the present, but with such a predictable  plot, you couldn't feel any tension  anxiety for the characters   Crichton did a good job of describing what  must  have been like to live   France during the Hundred Years War, but he forgot to include a good  plot  interesting characters  his book  Total tedium
Crichton's newest engrossing novel, Timeline, is a masterpeice of contemporary literature  When I first picked up the new novel, I thought  might be a horrible dissapointment like some of his books of the past  (ie Terminal man)  But this great new book combines the best of science,  technology  suspense   you have never liked Crichton before, you must  read this book
Michael Crichton comes up with some fascinating concepts based on cutting-edge science ( pseudo-science)  sometimes delivers a really entertaining novel, as he did with Jurassic Park  His &quot;Lost  World&quot; sequel to that book however was a letdown   Timeline,  unfortunately, more closely resembles his Lost-World effort The opening  chapters nicely tease the reader with the prospect of  &quot;multiverse&quot; travel  the possibility of sending 20th21st  century humans on a trip into the distant past  This could have made a  great high-technology yarn a-la the best novels of Tom Clancy   Unfortunately, once the travelers arrive  the 13th century the story bogs  down as the characters become engaged  one unlikely misadventure after  another   Not only did I lose my willingness to suspend disbelief, I also  lost interest  the story  I had looked forward to reading Timeline but I  was glad when I finished   could move on to something more satisfying   A disappointing read
I found the book quite interesting  my opinion,  is actually a history log, science factfile  a novel all rolled into one single exciting book! The facts are easily understood as they are well-explained   unlike some of Crichton's previous  novels which didn't really succeed   getting younsters  understanding them Great book on the whole  that's worth your money spent!
Mr Chrichton, always inventive, has a good idea  this book Unfortunately, he has become so used to writing movies that he actually cuts this thing up like a movie  at the same time turns  into a chase  instead of a storybr br I missed seeing Mr Crichton explore the universe (  multiverse)  which he has placed his characters I think he actually used  the scene where someone starts sliding over a cliff (a la Jurassic Park)  three times! 's very weak  this respect  really destroys what should  have been a good readbr br Mr Crichton doesn't lack skill  intelligence,  but he has become too used to the Hollywood perspective,  he has lost   misplaced his storytelling sensebr br EKW
Typical Crichton adventure  The book was very well thought out  exciting  The concept of &quot;time travel&quot; is intrigueing along with interesting history of the middle ages  I've never read a bad Chrichton  book This one rates up there with his best works  'll keep you   suspense!
Although  started with an interesting spark,  quickly became almost painfully uninteresting to read  However,  you can stay awake long enough, that will change  The last 23rds of the book builds quickly   won't let you go  Timeline started with 1 star  ended with a 5
I really look forward to each new Crichton book release I appreciate the work he puts into each book He obviously researches his subject matters extensively Timeline is no exception The combination of quantum mechanics   feudal France is interesting However,  seems that Crichton is  writing screenplays instead of novels these days Overall, this is a very  entertaining book but not one of Crichton's best
You've got the research down well; the plot is transparent, the people hollow, the coincidences unworthy of you! I wanted  deserved better! You wrote a Hollywood script; no need to think -- the twists  turns are all  too predictable Good read for JFKLHR trip -- then leave on the 747!
Mr Crichton has written a pretty good story here  Scientific explanations of the multiverse are understandable (probably to be scorned by real physicists,but whatever), plot is tight  really good on timing   Crichton's weakness as a writer tends to be character development,   TIMELINE is no exception  The characters are, at best, a sketchy set of  skills  traits without much depth   will make a better movie!  Read   anyway - 's a fun ride You'll be ahead of the pack when you see the  flick br A much better books on the same theme:  Connie Willis' DOOMSDAY  BOOK
Simply not up to Crichton's normal, groundbreaking efforts  A great idea for a story  well written - but I did feel  was too similar to Jurassic Park  concept  A good read but wish I'd waited for the  paperback edition  I'm currently enjoying his &quot;Travels&quot; trade  paperback
While  lacks some of the appeal of some of his earlier titles (such as more 3-dimensional characters), Crichton has done his research on medieval society  culture  still delivers a good, solid novel overall  Definitely worth a read
I don't read Crichton, but I got this book as a gift  The beginning got me all excited-- this is a really cleaver idea!  The first 75 pages were very mysterious  you wondered where the author was going to take this   But the book regresses quickly into a series of chase scenes with causal  beheadings at every turn  There are serious plot holes (why not go back to  10 seconds before the professor arrives to keep him from getting lost?    they are traveling to a different dimension  not a different time, how  does Marek end back  this dimension?)   the one open-ended mystery of  the book (who else has an earpiece?  de Kere?  Guy?) is resolved  a  couple of throwaway paragraphs  Maybe this is how Crichton writes (eye  candy for the computer game generation), but I think he dropped the ball on  this one
Am I the only reviewer who was reminded of the TV show Sliders? Right down to the Professor, the girl,  two younger men  I wonder  Crichton had been watching this TV series when he got the idea for the book  I did  enjoy the story,  spite of the predictability,  the never-ending  cliffhangers  I found myself almost overwhelmed by so much action; there  was never a dull moment  The historical aspects were a plus,  Crichton  did manage to accomplish what only a very good writer can:  he kept me  turning the pages!
The Book Timeline is very good except for his  explanation of the quatom technology  is hard to understand the technology but will not ruin the book with that small problem The other sections of the book of which take  place  the past seem very written  researched on The ending is also  very good  you will not expect what happens except all that all the main  characters survive
I do NOT understand what the other less rated reviewers read, but  most surely was not Timeline  I have read all of his books starting with Andromeda Strain  the early 1970's,  I think this book has more depth   thought  He did a lot of research to produce this book  from the  physics to the time period, my imagination left the room  The characters  were very well described as well as the terrain involved  each setting   This will be a movie as sure as Jurrasic Park wasbr I am not a casual book  reader as I read all the time  I am also considered a very picky reader  not easily entertained  This is one of the best books I have ever read
What a horrible disappointment  I find  hard to believe the same author who wrote the the books first 20  so pages wrote the remainder of the book  My mouth watered when hearing of a modern day tale of time travel to  the medievel era by Crichton What incredible poor character  development De Kere left behind ?   The professor?  The Green Chapel  Knight?  After figuring out the ending early  the book ( we know how many  die), I was awaiting some plot twist but this never came  will be a long  time before I read another of his books again
After reading a handful the other reviews for this book, I began to realize that &quot;Timeline&quot; may not be for everyone   my opinion, Michael Crichton brilliantly weaves the intricasies of today's  technological advancements with the intriguing elements of an unfamiliar  historical culture to captivate the minds of imaginative readers  Genius  descriptions of physical  chemical phemnomena make this fiction novel at  times seem all too real  The development of the characters seem to cater  to a smooth transition to the movie screen, but I feel that this is what  makes this book such a smooth, captivating read   you love physics   history, the time spent reading this book is a small price to pay for the  entertainment  brings  A ten-hour movie  your head without the budget  restraints on special effects (of course reading time may vary)!  Happy  Reading
A fabulous trip to  from another time?  Whether you agree with the premise of Crichton's &quot;travel&quot; scenario  not,  is fascinating nonetheless  A unique  intriguing web of technology  the romance   the 14th century  Crichton weaves an engaging tale that acquaints the  reader with quantam physics as well as broadswords-man-ship, all  a  cohesive storyline  Highly readable  A great story which captures   sustains our attention with a terrific plot  vivid mental images of the  14th  21st century
I have always enjoyed Michael Crichton books, they are great page-turning stories that seem to grip you  a way that forbids you from putting them down They never have very interesting characters, but their blandness   the past have been over compensated by some of the most original, Thought  provoking twists  turns Timelime will not let you stop reading, once  you start But when you get to the end  you reflectoh dear! This  basically a great Dr Who story, not a bad thing  itself but  unfortunately this is marketed to a adult audience  So 5stars  you are  8- 13 years old, 2stars 15 plus years old Disagree ? all I can say is The  Mad Green Knight Who Lives Is The Magic Cave,  I rest my case
I had trouble putting this book down  Very interesting plot  wonderfully exciting story  The author has an excellent grasp of the time period he's writing about  I'm certain this book will end up a major  motion picture  Highly recommended reading
I will give Mr Chrichton this: he is without a doubt the most original thinker  modern American fiction  The ideas he spawns ( the detailed research her performs) are excellent  His books, however, never seem to  finish the race  Almost always, I am completely caught  his web at the  beginning  then left unsatisfied at the end  Timeline is no exceptionbr This book is a fascinating idea,  the first half moves purposefully  toward character development  Unfortunately,  then turns into Die Hard  sans Bruce Willis   the books was 200 pages longer, he may have been  able to develop the characters more  bring the book to a natural ending  Now,  is predictable (completely)  has a huge leap of logic   development at the endbr The bottom line is that while I enjoyed the book  somewhat,  was more for the idea than for the executionsomething I  could have gotten from the jacket
I thought that this book was a non-stop page turner! I didn't want  to end - I can't wait for the movie! My only complaint is that  was too short!
Some may complain this book reads like a screenplay,   does  However, the story is enthralling  exciting, the action intense, the characters well developed   typical Crichton style, he has thoroughly  researched both the historical aspects of the middle-age time period   the quantum physics aspects,  is able to bring them to the reader on an  easily digestible platter  Aside from being a terrific  slightly  predictable story, this book spurred an interest  both the middle ages   quantum physicscomputing for me  Highly recommended
I simply enjoy Chrichton's writing, after reading all his fictional books, I can say that this was a treat, as were the others I like his way of explaining difficult scientific material to where a simple person like I,  can honestly understand  He makes me feel intelectual  his writing is  an orgasm for the brain
I was sorely disappointed by this story which is nothing but a recycling of the Jurassic Park tale We once again have a misguided (evil?) individual who wants to create the ultimate theme park ride for  vacationers There are plenty of two-dimensional characters, including the  story's hero, who studies dead languages, jousting, sword-fighting   archery  his spare time All of this  just happens to come  handy when  he needs to travel back to medieval Europe I guess he just knew that one  day he would need all this archaic expertise  order to fill the holes   Mr Crichton's plot The descriptions of medieval England are wonderfully  detailed, but even there the world the author has invented is peopled with  uninteresting, flat characters who behave like villains  an Errol Flynn  movie
An easy read that kept me on the edge of my seat A must read for anyone
Spent most of my day reading Crichton's new novel 'Timeline' - a well paced, well constructed narrative that is highly entertaining I was looking forward to this new tale because I've observed Crichton's career over the last twenty years  have been impressed with its development  His 'tried  true' formula for telling a good story improves with every  book he writes This particular novel is a fine-tuned machine that  addresses the theory of quantum physics  relation to time travel The  story concerns a group of post graduates who travel back  time to the  12th century  an effort to rescue their teacher  mentor who, because  of reasons that cannot be discussed, is trapped  medieval France The  story booms along from there at a riveting tempo What I love about  Crichton's novels is that the reader  most cases will learn something:  his books have a distictive pedagogical motivation For example, mind  control  psychiatric surgery  'Terminal Man'; the aviation industry   'Airframe'; genetics  'Jurasic Park';  finally, quantum physics  a  new approach to academic history  'Timeline'  However, don't let the  word 'Quantum' physics put you off reading the novel: Crichton manages to  explain the theory at a level where any Year 10 student can easily  understand 'Timeline' is Crichton at his best! (I read the book  one  sitting!) Read , learn  enjoy Craig Middleton
I had to read this as  was the monthly selection for my book club  I had never read a Michael Crichton book before, so I had nothing to compare  to  I found the book enjoyable to some degree, but thought the  believability factor went out the window almost immediately   as almost  as  the author was trying to go over the readers' heads with all the  quantum physics references so that we wouldn't question the storyline  The  characters had no real depth  there were far too many characters,  especially  the medieval parts  The characters cheated death too many  times for their escapes to have any kind of credibility  Also, let's face  , would a person with the personality of Doniger really be so far ahead   have so many loyal employees  the real world?  The book was pretty  enjoyable  parts, but 's not going to make me want to pick up another  Crichton book  a hurry
The only good thing I have to say about Timeline is that Crichton did his homework on mideval France  QMbr As a book, however,  was terrible The characters are paper-thin, the story is predictable,  the plot has  more holes than a five pound block of swiss cheese (Ask yourself this,   's dimension  NOT time travel, how did the note appear at their  site?)br Don't wait for paperback, wait for the movie Maybe with some  decent acting, this story might be worth sitting through As  is,  however,  will leave you wishing you could travel to another dimension to  get your money back
Overall, I enjoyed the story Unfortunately, that was about the first  the last 100 pages The middle just seemed a little on the slow side I would still recommend the book; 's just not one of his best
I am a huge Crighton fan  have read all but 2 of his books, but  his latest work, I feel that he is compromising something  I think this is a fun, light read, but not impressed  MC needs to go back  visit his  original writing style  I think he will be on top again
I was sorely disappointed by this story which is nothing but a recycling of the Jurassic Park tale We once again have a misguided (evil?) individual who wants to create the ultimate theme park ride for  vacationers There are plenty of two-dimensional characters, including the  story's hero, who studies dead languages, jousting, sword-fighting   archery  his spare time All of this  just happens to come  handy when  he needs to travel back to medieval Europe I guess he just knew that one  day he would need all this archaic expertise  order to fill the holes   Mr Crichton's plot The descriptions of medieval England are wonderfully  detailed, but even there the world the author has invented is peopled with  uninteresting, flat characters who behave like villains  an Errol Flynn  movie
I think I would have been able to enjoy this book more had I been able to read  straight through, instead of having to look for missing pages! My pages 275-306 were duplicated from other pages  the book To my dismay,  the missing pages were nowhere to be found What kind of publishing goof-up  do you call this!
My first Crichton book  I thought  was excellent, I was absorbed from the first to the last page His descriptions allowed me to paint wonderful images  my mind of how &quot;I&quot; pictured 14h century France
Aside from the lack of character development, Crichton gives us a nice start with riddles, a death, a policeman  a doctor  the first few pages  I felt there should have been a build up of pressure from the  medical  legal sectors towards ITC, but Crichton blows that direction  off with a paragraph  twobr Others state that the story read like a  screen play  I agree  Even Star Trek always sent one  two security  personnel to the adventure site so they could be killed  Losing one  two  futurists to the hardships of mideval times would have made the story more  compellingbr  was a fun read; like spending time at an amusement park   I blew through the book, but once finished I didn't have that lost friend  feeling--wishing the story could go on forever--that a 5 star story would  leave me with, but  sure beat watching TV!  Rising Sun  Jurasic  Park--lost a few characters  that book to the dangers of the  environment!--were better examples of Crichton's story telling capacity   br Glad  was a Christmas present for two reasons--fun story  I didn't  have to pay for !
Well, I did enjoy the brief lectures of Quantum physics, however  seems he left too many holes to truly explain the plot For example,  this is a &quot;split&quot; dimension of time, how could anything they do affect the  future? Why the concern  what they did did not matter, considering  was  not our time specifically they travelled back to? I agree with most of  these reviews, the characters were stiff  simply basic I have seen  better development  ten page short stories One of the book's somewhat  few strong points, however, is the accuracy  depicting the past This  accuracy, unfortunately, is ruined over  over by the seemingly endless  good fortune of the characters as they escape one disaster after another I  like a good suspense as much as anyone, but when you keep building suspense  without consequence (when you just keep letting everyone get away scratch  free) you're no longer writing a book, you're drawing a cartoon
I've loved his books from Andromeda Strain on This book, although beginning  a great Creighton fashion, quickly deterioriates into pure convoluted garbage of unlikely events that will challenge the credulity of  even a third grade student Anyone who cares enough about what will happen,  to read on to the end, has my admiration
I have to sympathize with a few of the other reviewers on this one  I was excited to read Crichton's new book thinking that the plot line would be an exciting one  However, midway through I felt as though I was reading a screenplay  not a book  This has too often been the calling sign of the  Crichton of late  Yes he can still dazzle us with his unbelievble  descriptiveness of that which most people don't understand, but he too has  become commercialized  I wish he would just go back to being a great  writer, like the days of Andromeda Strain  Now that was a work of art
Crichton is my favorite living author,  The Great Train Robbery is my favorite book of his  Temper my review with that  I really hoped this would warrant a second reading, but  was un-Crichton-like to have such  muddled explanations, even  qmech was the topic  I liked the story  I  have no idea where he could have possible gotten the idea   was  interesting  somewhat suspenseful the whole way through   beyond   being his book,  didn't really get much push, advertising-wise, so I  liked   Good enough as  is
 what is one of Crichton's most engaging works, the reader is offered a hypnotizing swirl of cutting-edge futurist theory  an equally sophisticated view of medieval Europe   Crichton's resourcefulness  the world of theoretical science is emphasized more strongly than ever while he  makes a fine debut  the field of historically-based literature   The  story may prove to be especially intriguing to those who have previously  defined the medieval period  terms of Monty Python  Period  Role-playing games(I speak from experience)   My advice for the reader is  to avoid the frustration that may come  you read this novel expecting  only sci-fi  knights  shining armor  open yourself up to both angles  of this story
I found Michael Crichton's &quot;Timeline&quot;, to be an action packed trip to the past  He has strong character build  desribes every scene  detail which I found very helpful to one's imagination  Yes, the novel  reads like a screen-play  a movie deal may be just around the corner,  but  you love entertainment, action, added with a little computer lingo  then, Michael Crichton's, &quot;Timeline&quot;, is a book for you
Would make a soso plot for the old twilight zone TV series
I'll say I did enjoy the read - especially the first half  There were some surprises  a sense of anticipation  The last half was interesting - especially  you're into the medievel time period - but predictable  I  was very disappointed  the ultimate purpose for the time travel  technology - not very original for an author of Crighton's caliber
I thought this book was excellent!  Although  focused on quantum physics technology  was not written so that a lay person could not understand   What an adventure!  I was angry when I finished  I wanted more!  Good reading!
Would make a soso plot for the old twilight zone TV series
This book was simply Jurassic Park except instead of bringing creatures from the past to the present  puts creatures from the present into the past   you read the book,  is obvious to see the similarities, though  I don't reccomend reading the book  The only thing I got out of  was the  interesting historical information, but the crazy,  extremely annoying  thing about the historical info was that he would have a few historical  paragraphs, then have that information interrupted by plot action,  he  would enver finish saying what he started  There is no suspense  the  lack of a setting, I dont know what he was trying for there  The science  is somewhat fictionalized, but there is a very slight chance of  being  possible, as  jurassic park Overall, this book was a disappointment,   I do not reccomend 
The book was a good yarn Unfortunately,  read a lot like a movie This is good for frenetics, but  hinders character developement There were places where  was hard to put the book down, but there were also  stretches where I could guess the outcome of every page The introduction  was classic  very alluring Unfortunately,  also created an  expectation that wasn't met The book wasn't great, but  wasn't horrible  either  was a decent, no-brainer action oriented read  could've used  some more physics  hard science Finally, unless your a Crichton  collector, get  at the library  buy the paperback
Don't get me wrong--Timeline's a great read Heck, I read   just a couple days Didn't want to put  down Great idea, set  an interesting time period Yes,  does read like a screenplay--you basically move from  action scene to action scene with little character development  you like  that sort of thing, you'll love Timeline Some of the action scenes are  completely engrossing What bugged me, however, was how fraught the book  was with inconsistencies, dropped story elements,  even blatant errors  Where was Crichton's editor? On vacation? , what really got me riled up  was his lack of research when  came to the female characters He spends  pages discussing men's clothing  fourteenth century France, but makes no  mention of what the women were wearing, other than they were   &quot;period clothes&quot; (This may seem like a little point, but  clothing is an important part of the plot,  how Crichton chooses to  dress the female lead character is historically inaccurate)  seems like  Crichton is getting sloppybut  you can ignore the inconsistencies,  's a great read
Chricton's a good author, so Timeline is still a great &quot;fun&quot; book to read  However,  has two very large faultsbr Firstly  is brutal  This may be the result of a Medieval setting, but the neverending  killing gets tiring  How many &quot;He sliced his sword through his  innards&quot; does he need?br Secondly,  is cheesy  A geeky 10 year old  solves the mystery of the mad scientist  The friend of the  &quot;lost&quot; timetravelers figures out how to get them back by thinking  about auto reasoningbr Every 5 pages end with a cliffhanger (many of which  are &quot;She knew that So--so is now dead&quot;)  Sure enough  So--so shows up three pages later  Good grief!br  you like Chrichton,  read &quot;Eaters of the Dead,&quot; &quot;Great Train Robbery,&quot;   &quot;The Terminal Man,&quot; instead
Like usual Michael kept me interested Timeline is action packed,suspensefull,informative,educational, just about what you expect from Michael Crichton Even from the begining, questions start to pop up, I  was constantly trying to anticipate what might happen but I never could I  highly recommend  
This is simply a fun book that will keep you turning the pages  Is  predictable? Yep I am a better person for reading ?  Nope  However, I can't remember just sitting back  enjoying a book like this  a long  time  The plot is quick  The period detail is interesting  A very  enjoyable book
Timeline is well researched  has an exciting plot  However, the character development is almost non-existent   you like a fun read  don't care about the characters, then this book is for you   you're  looking for something more, you'll be disappointed
Pardon the abbreviated grammar, but 1,000 words not enough disappointing, considering previous works like JP, Congo, Rising Sun This one is formula-driven, overwrought, melodramatic Tries to derive suspense  from too many cliff-hangar moments (literally) instead of any real  imagination Doesn't establish enough reason for the characters to be  risking their lives for the uncharasmatic Professor Felt like Chichton  wanted to skip the re-write  made this directly into a movie script  (which you know  will be) I thought  ironic that the only other  negative review I read came from a German- all the 5-star reviews must have  come from Americans who either haven't read many other Chrichton works,   are the type of people who made cheesy movies like Armageddon into  block-busters (what does that say about the state of American culture) On  the plus side: educational, as his books always are Explained quantum  physics  a way I could actually grasp That's  for plus side, back to  criticism the plot was basically rehashed from JP- academics get thrust  into the world that they study by a rich eccentric, get chased around by  bad-guys, etc  This book could have been so much better  he had put as  much attention into the story-telling as he did researching medieval times   The only attempted plot twist was fore-shadowed by the characters, so that  there were no real surprises; I could predict the ending by half-way  Overall, a big let-down Hmm I still have space left well, I've  wasted enough time on this book already  Incidentally- kudos to  Amazon  for having this review site (although now I'll be more wary of the reviews  considering all the 5-stars this book got)
God am I glad I'm finally done with this book   was entirely unbelievable from start to finish  I wholeheartedly agree with the reader below who said there were way too many close calls that could have (  should have) lead to the characters' deaths  We even get the obligatory  head-on-the-chopping-block contrivance  By my estimation these people  should have been dead within 5 minutes  The ending was completely  ludicrous (ask yourself honestly, is that how you would have dealt with  Doniger? )br I must also say that I disagree with the previous review -  there wasn't anywhere near enough discussion of quantum mechanics  The  little that was there demonstrated to me that (a) Chrighton knows nothing  of the field  (b)  was just a convenient cover to somehow have a story  about people going back  time  Although here is where he made a major  mistake:  the characters didn't go back into OUR time, they went to a  parallel universe that differs  time  This is a big difference as   eliminates all the time travel paradox's that Chrighton tries to  includebr A very weak effort on Chrighton's part
I'd say only the first 20 pages  so of the book was goodafter that there are just too many characters that were thrown   the story becomes too engrossed  the medieval eranot what I was expecting from  Crighton  Perhaps  gets better, but I find  hard to get involved
I found Timeline to be an amazing story, vividly portrayed as only Crichton can  Using both modern science  history, he melded both concepts into one,  created another top notch book  Once I started  reading, I couldn't put  down
I did enjoy the book (I'm glad others had a bit of difficulty with the physics also) but I almost could see  being written to be easily transformed into a movie  The characters did not have a lot of depth to  them  you can figure out what the outcome will be  The historical  information was wonderful  has gotten me to look for other books set   this time
After writing my original review, I went back  read more of the other reviews  I would like to apologize- there were  fact many other Americans who thought this book was one big cliche  Maybe American culture  isn't  such a bad place after all!   to all you 5-star reviewers who  tell us dissenters to lighten up- Crichton has written much better books   I'm sorry  I expect more from him now No, I'm not looking to him for  literature, but for at least something original  I think I'll start a club  for all the others who hated this book- you seem like my kind of people
I found this book an excellent source of entertainment  is at heart (  so  seemed to me) a rather old fashioned adventure with a breathtaking pace that really comes alive Mr Crichton is to be commended for bringing  the 14th century alive for a modern reader I understand that people who  don't care much about history may not appreciate all the details of  medieval life but I found  fascinating Is  a perfect book? No, there  are a couple of details that I would have preferred different, but overall,   is a book very hard to put down once  gets going The time travel  element is definitely different ( a far cry from Jack Finney's great  classic &quot; Time  Again&quot;) but  is a thought provoking theory  I am sure  would make a great movie, but no movie could possibly match  the book for excitement, but then, movies are very rarely as good as the  book Having read 3 previous works by this author I have no problem stating  this is the best I have read by him  The book is filled with all sorts of  quaint ( to us ) characters, full of surprising situations, ingenious  chases  escapes  I found myself caring for the good guys  the book
I rather liked the part of this novel that dealt with the historicalsomeone did a lot of research into French  medieval history  However, the quantum physics were WAY over my graspI just  scanned those partskinda like I did  high school physics classbr This  was an interesting story with some provocative points to ponderbr I agree  with other reviewers will make a good film!br Enjoy!
Already a fan of Crichton, he impresses me again with his research into the life of the 14th century  His characters, similar to Jurrasic Park, survive several ordeals that may seem improbable - even impossible - but  incredibly entertainingbr I do not know of another author that can  entertain so well  inform so deeply  This man takes emerging  technologies to 's furthest limits  lets the reader decide whether the  possible benefits  possible consequences out weigh the other br Loved  the book  When they make the movie, please don't change ANYthing!
Take the name Michael Crichton off this book  you would find few glowing reviews This book is a shame I have never read Michael Crichton before   he had written drivel like this all along he would be a shoe  salesman Good for him this wasn't his first effort! The characters are  simply names, the book is all dialogue  description, people pop up out  of nowhere at the most convenient times to save the day,  he even pulls  off the Star Trek trick of killing off the peripheral characters who beam  down to the planet just to add the element of danger! This book exists only  because there is a computer game  movie to be sold,  the movie will  need some help  's based on this For a good time travel book, read  &quot;Time on My Hands&quot;
I never really enjoyed Michael Crichton that much until this book Being a history buff, I enjoyed the parts  Castelgard immensely New age science with the wormholes also made  interesting The characters didn't not seem  to shallow, although Marek was too foreshadowed to be exciting Adrenaline  pumped action scenes carry the book onward This is a lighthearted  enjoyable book
I READ JUST 1 PAGE  PUT THE BOOK DOWN  WAS SO GREAT I DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER FINISHING BECAUSE I MIGHT HAVE OVER EXCITED MY SELF
Timeline by Michael Crichton is a true classic   you are into mideval novels,   you're into a good book that will make you want to keep reading, then this is for you  I highly suggest you read this book;  is  very intellectual  teaches many things to the reader  Either get this  out of a library,   you don't want to wait, then buy   The hardcover  book is about 450 pages, each one grabbing full attention from the reader   I truly believe this is one of the best books I've ever read
Maybe I'm a sucker for time travel books but I couldn't put this one down  Sure, Crichton telegraphs every move  the characters continue to escape from seemingly hopeless situations but for pleasure readingI wish   were twice as long  I didn't buy the book to learn about quantum physics  but rather to get my mind off work  into a more creative frame   Crighton did a good job at this with his description of life  the late  middle ages  He also set the tone so we didn't obsess over the  &quot;smashed butterfly changing the future we live &quot; scenario  Not  the best, but darn entertaining!
Crichton's latest attmept at mixing the present, high-tech world with the old, low-tech one is good,  fact, 's very good But  just doesn't measure up to his previous projects Perhaps this is the price for creating  so many good works The story, like most of his story lines, requires an  enormous leap of faith to accept a technology that is just a bit beyond  what we already have imagined That's the easy part The hard part is to  keep us is suspense on what turns out to be trips a alternate universes   past times I ddidn;t even try,  yet I was able to pick out the villian  some 100 pages before  was revealed  But I sound disappinted Acutally,   is a good read, I recommend  for everyone,  Cricton followers will  once again relish at this new work from their favorite author  wonder  who will play each of the parts  the movie
This book is one of the fastest reads you will ever come across Jousting, sword fighting, fudal battles,  a quantum mechanics lesson wraped all  one On of the most fun books I have ever read I give  a year  a half  before its  the movie theaters
I read about three quarters of the book  became so thoroughly fed up with  (no need to list the reasons yet again - book is like a film script - book is an amalgamation of action sequences - characters are  stereotypcial etc) that I did  fact put  down  turned to something  else, but what a sorry state of affairs: the author can not manage to  kindle enough interest  story  characters to keep the reader until the  end: I just didn't care anymore Maybe I was misled by the promising  introduction  the first, say, twenty pages of the book, but the  expectancy created therein is just not meet anywhere  the book
A tense, taut  highly engrossing drama  OK, not Shakespeare, but a thrilling page turner that builds to a terrific climax  Reads like a screeenplay (not a concidence, surely)  is easily digested  3-4 hours   Would recommend  to anyone
 begins well but develops into a dumbed-down Jurassic Park loaded with inconsistencies  every actionadventure cliche possible  Did Crichton really write this?  This book, after its promising opening, reveals no more  original thought than the worst B-movie you've ever seen  The only  redeeming quality is the (I imagine) accurate description of medieval  villages  castles   Most of Crichton's characters,  you can call them  that, are barely one-dimensional, especially the medieval folk, who are all  ugly, stinking, bloodthirsty knights, with the exception of one enigmatic   indecisive lady who suffers from multiple personality disoder  's a  quick read, but quicker  you skip    whatever
I never developed any feel for the characterscouldn't ( didn't care) to even visualize any of them  why did they need these historians to go get the Professor? I never could figure out the point
I bought this book for an escape from football over the holiday weekend  I wasn't disappointed!   was exciting  I couldn't put  down  Michael Crichton obviously put a lot of time  research into this book   Good science fiction always starts with the science of today,  then adds  a dream for tomorrow   you are looking for a good plot,  pure  entertainment you will enjoy Timeline   yes,  will make a great  action moviebr Thanks, Michael - for writing a great story!  I loved !
This book, which has a very interesting story line, is among the worst written books I have ever read  is repetitious  takes forever to get to the end that everyone knows will occur
Hey, this is a fun book  Is  gonna expand your intellect?  Nope  Does he kinda cross the bounds of familiarity he originally wrote  Jurassic Park?  A little  Is  still worth reading?  OF COURSE!  Just plain fun   I am completely puzzled at those who tore  to pieces  one who even  threw out the idea that  was written by several DIFFERENT people  I am  totally at a loss as to WHAT  the WORLD they were expecting  Some people  just OVER-Analyze things to the point that pretty soon they forget to just  sit back  enjoy what they have paid their hard-earned money on  I  personally think Crichton has given me MY money's worth,  for that, I am  VERY thankful--especially since 'Airframe' was a less than stellar novel of  adventure like his others  's a FUN book, pure  simple Sure there  are parts that are hard to believe, but hey!   He's talking about TIME  TRAVEL here,  you can suspend your belief to swallow THAT, then the LEAST  you can do is the premise that the characters can suddenly 'make ' out of  near-impossible situations on every other page Doesn't James Bond,   Indiana Jones do the SAME thing?   Of COURSE they do, but since Crichton  has written some novels that are easier to swallow because of the subject  matter, I guess we are to COMPLETELY believe EVERYTHING he writes IS   fact a scientific Probability  No WAY! He even writes at the end of the  book that Time Travel is purely  the realm of fantasy  Letbr us remember  that  our quest to enjoy a book that can be spendy these daysLighten  up!  This ISN'T Y2K's a GREAT BOOK  Let me know  you agree with my  opinione-mail me at:br           rmgomske@lightcomnetbr Thanks  have  a GREAT New Year!
For an author with the &quot;hype machine&quot; (read favorablepress)  fairly successful background of Michael Crichton, anyreader should have expected far more out of this book Unfortunately, &quot;Timeline&quot; reads like the work of an author who put very little effort into the storybr This book was another example of one that surely had plenty of promise as far as plot  also got off to a great start that read very quickly But, the story started to break up not even 100 pages ,  soon fizzled into a highly mediocre tale br I'll be the first to admit that I'm not very big  educated on science, but  really seemed like Mr Crichton was lamely groping to make up the rationale for his &quot;time travel&quot; concept He seemed to have very little factual basis for  (despite his numerous scientific references listed  the book),  he wrote as  he was trying to gloss over the tenuous thread he was on by speeding along the descriptions  breaking  up with other dialoguebr The story, once  got to medieval France, was also very l@#e There was so much that could have been done with the setting  the plot to that point I would propose that  felt like reading one of the old Bugs Bunny cartoons (when Bugs fought the Black Knight) Also, the time pressure built into the story made things even worse Mr Crichton already seemed to be hurrying along as thinly developed as the tale was; he didn't need any extra incentive with the 37-hour deadline the plot revolved aroundbr  my opinion, Mr Crichton has had a very checkered literary career I really enjoyed &quot;Andromeda Strain&quot;, &quot;Rising Sun&quot;,  especially &quot;Eaters Of The Dead&quot; Others I've read have been so-so to poor &quot;Timeline&quot;, I think, will rank as one of his worst efforts I will be very hesitant to read any future offerings because of this bookI certainly hope he'll put some more effort into his writing
I hope I spelled that right Anyway, my point is this is a highly entertaining novel,  I thought  was extremely fun  I couldn't put  down So  reads like a screenplay So what! Sometimes you want a good  old cliff-hanger,  this one does not fail to deliver The whole concept  of time-travel was very well explained,  I think Crichton's material on  fourteenth century France was very detailed  well researched br I  thought this was a great book; by that I mean  kept my attention  I  wasn't too distracted by the &quot;cinema-ready&quot; pace of the prose   I want to broaden my horizons intellectually, I will go back to the same  Joseph Conrad book I've been plowing through for the past year Meanwhile,  though, a diversion like &quot;Timeline&quot; was entirely welcome!
Michael Crichton spins a wonderful tale When reading you become engaged  the storySurprise, oh I cant even go through all the great attributes of this book  made me feel aliveonly the way a good book can excite  your mind, challenge then entertain  totally delight you Believe me   was a joy reading  I bet you will enjoy  immenselyyou wont regret  getting this booksincerely
I also, like other readers, became engrossed  the book,  had a hard time putting  down, but I must agree with others who complain that the book, which started so well, ended so badly One reviewer called   &quot;cartoonish,&quot;  I must agree An interesting idea, but   turned into something a good deal less
Crichton has evolved downward from books written as works to be judged on their own merit to those written with cool sets  lighting  mind While this is undeniably entertaining,  is a guilty pleasure - maybe  enough  of us didn't buy this, MC would decide to use his gifts to put together a  more challenging read I am willing to suspend belief to enjoy a good  novel, but the flimsy explanations here are laughable - no doubt because  they can be glossed over  a 1 12 hr movie script with 45 minutes of  battle scenes Anyway, see you at the theater
I thought this was a great book! Does  belong  the class of &quot;War  Peace&quot;? Of course not! But  you want a book that will keep you up all night reading , then this is the one Timeline replaces Jurassic  Park as my all-time Crichton favorite!
The writing  this book is awful  I agree with the others that there are WAY too many close calls - to the point of be laughable   the dialog is no better:  After Kate is saved by Chris (for the 12th time), she rubs his  shoulders  says &quot;My hero&quot;  I laughed out loud!   addition,  Timeline is a complete rip-off on Jurrasic Park, as far the basis for the  story goes  Evil company wants to provide realistic theme parks for public   make billions  - sound familiar?
Micheal Crichton once again has amazed us from his diversified knowledge  His incorporation of science fiction, history,  action, provide for a very realistic experience to the reader  His ideas about quantum physics  are explained  such lucidity, that even I, a thoroughly read man   Physics, fell for his explanation, which really is mere Science Fiction   But  is this ablity of Crichton, his knowlegde  depth of the subject  matter, that makes each  every book of his such a masterpiece   is  truly an enjoyable book to read with an exciting story line,  a great  set of characters, whom we might find parallels  real life  I recommend  this book to any sci-fi, time travel, physics, history,  any avid reader  for its superb content
The book starts *exactly* as Jurassic Park  An unexplained medical emergency  A scientific mystery based around a mega-wealthy, but secretive company  Except this time, instead of bringing the past to the future,  Critchon brings the future to the pastbr Ever since The Lost World,  Crichton has sold out  He doens't write books anymore  He writes bad  movies -- formula movies -- that will undoubtedly make oodles of  moneybr  Timeline, the characters are as shallow a river  Death  Valley  The villians are mindless monsters who have no motive  reason to  thier madness (even the Raptors  JP acted more intelligently)  The  plot takes the same twists  turns over  over again -- until the  reader knows what is going to happen before  doesbr The best part of the  book:  The 3 Page Introduction  Read that, cry for the lost potential of  an old-style Crichton story about time-travel,  move on  Don't waste  your time here
I rushed out to buy this new Crichton book because he always produces a good, yet thought provoking read  I have to say that I was very disappointed   was like reading a rough draft  maybe a rough draft of  a movie script The idea was wonderful  clever but that is all  was:  an idea  I depend on Mr Crichton to do my research for me  then  explain  to me  an entertaining manner but he failed this time, I'm  afraid  I won't give up though I'll rush out  buy the next one
You can see the book was written for Hollywood Very promising start The end fizzles out like a wet squib Totally impossible situations with little  no characterizations Very flat characters There is no effort to bring  the intrigue, ignorance  the changing Middle Ages to life -  serves  merely as a background for phenomenal chases  stunts
I'm beginning to believe that Crichton's books are just therough drafts of movie screenplays  However,  you like a typicalCrichton--rich guy decides to exploit horribly fantastic cutting edge science to basically create a theme park storyline--you are  for a treat  I am interested  the 100 Years War, so I found the history to be typically well researched  accurate  This is one of Crichton's strong points  However, he kinda dropped the ball on the quantum mechanics end of things  He was correct  that  is called the &quot;multiverse theory&quot;, but that's about   Let's just say get ready to do some serious willful suspension of disbelieve here   you can overlook that,  is quite a fast-paced joyride to the 14th century  All  all, a decent book
i have to wonder is michael crichton is trying to write books   he's simply writing the screenplay ahead of time  While his research was good   added to the theory of time travel, the story was predictable as all  hell   was just a little too conveniant for me, the way that everyones  talents magically became important  the other world,  the way   climaxed  Crichton should take a lesson from Tom Harris  at least try  to throw a little unpredictability into the book  While  was  adventurous,  was basically Jurassic Park with a different set of  scientists (historians) being the heroes,  a different kind of  technology (quantum physics) being the evil  Entertaining: yes, to a 6th  grader  Thought-provoking: hardly
First, the negatives  I like characters I can sympathize with,  the main 4 charachters here were hard to get behind  This is due to more time spent explaining how time travel is possible(but 's really  trans-dimensional travel),  describing the what-for's of 14th century  life  The one character I really liked was Lady Claire,  she was a  secondary character  Also, the explanation of  time-travel(trans-dimensional travel) is tedious  quite unbeleivable  according to those  the know   my last real beef is that  reality,   these academics went back to 14th century France, only Marek would have  even the slightest chance of surviving  That being said, I'd like to  finish on the positives  's a grand adventure story involving  time-travel  I thoroughly enjoyed   The detail  which 14th Century  life is described is astounding   taught me quite a lot while  entertaining me immensely  Fighting, jousting, narrowly escaping death at  every turn 's a heck of a page turner   you check your brain at the  dedication page  read  strictly for entertainment value, you can't go  wrong( you like these types of stories)
This book is a total waste Starts with a great premise Ends up as a cartoon People almost get killed but never doRepeatedly The book just turns into a pointless chase, with an artificial time limitation to move   along Save your moneySave your time
This book was very engagingI couldn't wait to finish  I started  one night  finished the next afternoon  Great combination historical fictionadventure story, with some science fiction thrown  for good  measure  To those who say the quantum physics aren't accurate, 's not a  textbook, 's FICTION Enjoy the story!
I recieved the hardcover of Timeline for Christmas  Like Crichton's other books, Timeline is an exciting read that doesn't dissappoint  Until Timeline, the only way I had witnessed the idea of time travel used was   a comical  unbelieveable setting  This is the first book I have ever  read that actually made me think that time travel is a real possibility   Many writers would be biting off more than they could chew with the ideas   theories  Timeline, but, as usual, Crichton pulls  off with ease   The characters are deep  engaging   you like Michael Crichton's  earlier works, you'll like Timeline too   you haven't read Crichton yet,  then start with this one
I am a big fan of Michael Crichton  enjoyed &quot;Timeline&quot; immensely However I thought there were too many Indiana Jones type moments  the book  No matter what situation the characters found themselves ,  you always knew they would escape virtually unharmed Some of the  situations seemed contrived just to fill out the book The ending seemed  somewhat abrupt, with no explanation for what happened to a certain  character  Overall, a good book but not up to the usual Crichton  thriller
Dr Crichton's new book Timeline is truly an old-fashioned adventure story Not to be overlooked, however, is the theme that underscores many of his works To wit, we should be wary of having an unbridled faith   technology While technology can be wondrous,  can also place  danger  as a result of its unintended consequences  Timeline, the quantum foam  wormhole, ie time machine, transports the major characters back to  medieval France A simple rescue mission becomes a life-threatening  adventure  giving us a non-stop adventure story, Crichton seems to be  reminding us that just because something is technologically feasible,  should  be done? This is Crichton's best work since Jurassic Park
As I got further  further into this book, all I could think of was Spielberg's schlocky movie, The Goonies The entire last half of the book is one ridiculous  unbelievable action sequence after another  Crichton  had such a rich subject to work with here;  could've been so much better  than next year's cheesy summer action movie  Next time, write the novel  before the screenplay, okay?
I just finished reading this book Not since Jurassic Park has Crichton written such an engaging masterpiece Now,  could be because I'm a physics major  have had an unsatiable thirst for medieval stories since  I was a kid, but this book kept me up until 2:30  the morning reading ,   I couldn't put  down Crichton uses vivid details  masterful  storytelling to present the reader with such a suspenseful  realistic  story Definitely one of his best works
While some of Crichton's works can be dry  too technical Timeline delivered a great read - back to the Jurassic Park style  Really worth the read with a great ending
Crichton is amazing: he can take subjects I could never think I would find slightly interesting  make them incredible page turners: never thought I would care about dinosaurs running around, female on male discrimination,  airplane safety  60 minute-production lifestyles, etc; moreover, you  feel like you learn something from fiction   This book is a fine addition  to the Crichton world  Mixing time-travel with 14th century France is so  much more enjoyable than I could have ever believed  I would have given   four  a half stars  possible
This is the kind of book that I find myself reading despite myself  's not very well written, but just entertaining enough to keep one involved  Crichton did  much better  Jurassic Park: Timeline is little more than  a rewrite of Jurassic Park with castles instead of the theme park   vicious knights  armor instead of vicious dinosaurs  Unlike Jurassic  Park, Timeline is not very well written  frequently absurdly  implausible  Having spent my career  Silicon Valley, 's painfully  obvious to me that Crichton hasn't the faintest clue of what high  technology companies are like,  his plot contortions to set the scene  reminded me of a bad high school creative writing assignment  The frequent  injections of grotesque violence are clearly written with a future film  version  mind: they provide little impact on the written page  add  little to the story
This book reads more like a screen play then a novel The characters are shallow  under developed Our heroes are constantly put into dire situations only to be saved at the last moment by some fantastic turn of  events The characters from the past are stereotypical Hollywood types,  either slobbering oafs  twisted mad men  I personally think the movie  will be better then the book  this casebr Paul
I have read some of his prior books,  I would have to say that I enjoyed this one the most  Although the first 50-60 pages are a little slow, the action picks up  is one that you won't want to put down   Crichton's story is so detailed that you can only appreciate the research  that he did for this book  The idea of time travel is so intriguing,   this book throws an interesting twist to the subject   you like Crighton  books  books about the middle ages, this is one book that you should give  a chance
I just finished reading Timeline Not since Jurassic Park has Crichton written such an engaging masterpiece Now,  may be because I'm a physics major  have had an insatiable thirst for medieval stories since I was a  kid, but this book had me up until 2:30  the morning Crichton is at his  best with this suspenseful  vivid novel Timeline is unquestionably one  of,  not THE best book he's written
Save your money  wait for the movie The book reads like a screenplay Disappointing
Michael Crichton would have been better served  he had sent his time travelers back  time to interview more capable authors,  the hope that they might bring back some tips that might add a second  third dimension  to his writing This book is cartoonish at best Reading this book is like  watching Vic Morrow  TV's Combat We know who is going to get whacked by  book's end - just as soon as we meet all the characters How these  fish-out-of-water characters survived their adventure is explainable only  by the fact that the big stars who play them  the movie have to stick  around long enough to justify their paychecks Is there any cliche not  touched on  this writing-by-the-numbers exercise? Crichton phoned this  one  Let's see  I replace the dinosaurs with knights,  I replace  the island with a castle Ka-ching goes the cash register!
's very well researched  I kept turning for the action, but also very much for the details  The bibliography speaks to this  Its a shame though  This will most likely be another movie  will consume Criton's  timebr The plot wasn't much different than Jurassic Park,   the  technical details were glossed over by his CEO device  But the book still  was a great blend,  I don't fault him for not having the schematics to a  timeteleportation machine  His answer regarding the machines on the other  side was a bit annoying though :-
Several of the reviews I read before I ordered this book warned me about `s shortcomings but the story line sounded good si i figured i would enjoy  anyway Well i did, but they were right  was a bit thin   parts  reads a lot like one of those books that comes out after the  movie does The story line is great  has a lot of merit,but  could  have been a whole lot better with a bit more character development  some  more time invested  background details by the author A lot of the book  only gives just enogh information so you move into the next chapter as  quickly as possible Do authors get paid by the book  the word?  this  case  must have been the latter     you like sword fights, medieval  battles , castles, devious but endearing damsels  time travel on top of  all of that - `s still a good read  you can overlook the rest  have  an active imagination to fill  the blanks!
This is another superb novel written by the king of novels  I could not put this book down for a second  Crichton did an excellent job researching medievil customs  warfare,  the result was an action packed mixture  of history  science  br I would recommend this book to anyone who is  interested  science fiction  anybody that is a history buff  Last book  that was this hard to let go was Jurassic Park  Three words &quot;READ  THIS BOOK&quot;
TIMELINE starts out interestingly,  I had hopes for , but  disintegrates into every time- machine-B-movie you've ever had to endure on the late late show that you were only watching because you had insomnia   Crichton is ripping himself off here JURASSIC PARK  THE LOST WORLD  were fish-out-of-water--another-time (so to speak) books Crichton  directed the movie &quot;West World&quot;  THAT was a  fish-out-of-water movie (suburbanites  the old west)  here  is  again I wouldn't mind Crichton mining the same vein,  he did   successfully But since he's failing at  (&quot;Westworld&quot; was his  only successful attempt at that plot, I think), he should try a different  plot on for size
Is  &quot;scientifically accurate?&quot;  Probably notbr Is  &quot;realistic?&quot; Nobr Is  full of suspense?  Nobr But, is  FUN?  YES!br Give the guy a break  He's not writing for MIT students; nor is  he trying to win a Nobel Prize for Literature  He simply wrote an  entertaining book mixing together some deep scientific theories with  historybr I found  interesting  a fun readbr ps: There were quite a  few editing errors that were obviously missed  the rush to get the book  out for Christmas
Crichton produces a very interesting story about war torn France Historically, he does an excellent job of capturing the attitude of the people  of the countries However, some of the mystery  previous  Crichton novels is lacking  fact there is hardly any suspense  mystery   this plot Crichton attempts to make the character of de Kere more  mysterious  abstract but fails miserably I would have liked Crichton to  withhold more of the plot from the reader Nevertheless I enjoyed the  historical aspects of this book  was a quick book; I easily finished    three days Not his best, but one of Crichton's better novels
Now, before I start the review let's get a few things straight Michael Crichton, is not, nor will be, a great literary wordsmith The plots  his books never really have any major unforeseen twists,  frankly the  characters are built more on social  cultural stereotypes than Mr  Crichton's development (with the possible exception of Ian Malcolm)  'Timeline' has more of these, including the Professor (that's actually how  he is referred to)  the evil bad guy tycoon Furthermore ( this  becomes icreasingly irritating), instead of describing some of the 14th  century surroundings to a greater extent, Mr Crichton includes pictures  (!) of them All this aside, 'Timeline' is still a damn entertaining read   doesn't have the eery feel of Jurassic Park, but  is as much a  pageturner as 'Airframe,' 'Disclosure,'  'Sphere' Sadly, Mr Chrichton  seems to skimp more  more on the substance of the action, much like   'The Lost World' Now, each book seems like a light mixture of two  screenplays (one of an action film, one of a 'Mr Wizard' episode) put into  narrative form Furthermore, ( this is as irritating as the pictures)  Mr Chrichton  the last half of the book seems to think that good  suspense is built like the 110-m hurdles One adversity ( adversary) is  followed by another,   the last 100 pages you feel like you are  reading a description of someone playing a videogame The result, is of  course, that after all the trials  tribulations the end is  anti-climactic (Although a bit better than the endings of 'Congo'   'Jurassic Park'  'Sphere' where &quot;everything blows up&quot;)br The  real star of this horse--pony show is of course, science, which  this  book also mixes with history  that's what propels this book past  failures like 'Eaters of the Dead'br While 's not his best book ever,  Crichton still delivers,  my faults are largely with the author (still  my favorite mainstream writer) rather than with the book
This book is fast-paced, gripping,  kept me reading straight through the end  Vintage Crichton!
I love a good time-travel yarn, but this one seems pretty formulaic Once you get through the cursory but interesting discussion of quantum technology, you're left with a fairly mundane adventure yarn that's full of  action but desperately thin on characterbr I guess the thing that's most  disappointing about \\"Timeline\\" is that  never really gets beyond the  stereotypes we all have of medieval times - 's all swordplay  jousting    castle intrigue  I would have enjoyed a little more insight into the  time itself Surely not everyone  the Middle Ages was brandishing a  broadsword every second Surely there are some interesting contrasts   parallels between that time  this one br \\"Timeline\\" reads like a  screenplay,  I suppose that's what  really is: opening next summer   a theater near you Tarted up with special effects, the movie might  actually be more interesting than the book But I think I'll pass anyway
Mr Crichton should obtain a proficient editor  publisher; did he really write this? The writing is childish There are numerous punctuation mistakes Certainly is an interesting story - may make a great movie But  not a great book by any means
I just read this book  about 5 hrs over 2 days  can't be that bad  I actually thought  was a very entertaining  fun read  While  sort of reads like a screenplay  may be a bit linear, you will definitely not  want to stop  There were enough plot twists  surprises to keep   fresh Lighten up people  have some fun
 you've enjoyed any of his prior works,  especially  you're intrigued by medieval times, you're likely to enjoy Chrichton's latest  's inventive  acceptably, though not particularly well, pacedbr But  what Chrichton did most notably  this novel is combine three elements -  science fiction (time travel), ancient history (middle ages),  modern  technology (quantum mechanics  quantum theory) -  a truly interesting  way that had me thinking: While this couldn't possibly happen today, I can  hold open the possibility that  might  twenty-five, fifty  a hundred  yearsbr  short, a very enjoyable  entertaining read
sometimes you need a light book to take you through a saturday -  timeline does just that  's enjoyable enough that you will read  one sitting,  you won't feel bad afterwards - even though the ending is a  little silly  rushed  although - after you finish you might say - did i  just read a movie script  a novel?
All of the elements of Jurassic Park are here  Timeline Even the theme park idea I enjoyed Timeline, however a few elements of the plot grew tiresome The three characters involved were constantly being separated,  when their union was essential This is definitely a page turner, however  I admire the research that Crichton puts into his fiction
This book is not much of a time travel novel The characters get marooned  the past  try to survive to return to their present 85% of the action takes place  the past Nice  you're interested  the time  period Otherwise disappointing 's basically an Indiana Jones Meets the  Fourteenth Century type of story
I am so enamored of Crichton's books, I buy them hardback without glancing inside  This time I was surprised  disappointed  He obviously wrote this to make  a movie  While I also like movies, the mediums are  different  always shall be I expect my books to have heavy character  development, which was totally lacking here  A week after I read , I  wasn't able to tell anyone about  except that  was some sort of time  travel book  None of the characters were particularly appealing  I  really didn't care  they got back  time  not  They didn't seem a  &quot;team&quot; that even liked each other much To the author: either  write books as books  forget about movie making,  vice versa Ya can't  do both
Timeline is a page turner!  You don't need to understand anything about space travel to enjoy this ride through time  Crichton has well researched Middle Ages customs, practices, warfare,  other areas to make this  journey fun  For those with an eye for detail, you will relish  the  description of events  Especially noteworthy are the battles   scenerary  All of this puts you 'on location'  Timeline Enjoy this  read!  Share  with a friend!
The only thing missing from Crichton's last two books,  glaringly apparent  Timeline, are stage directions He's not writing books, he's writing movie treatments    The first part of the book does get ones hopes  up, but as soon as the mystery which opens the book is solved,  quickly  disolves into chaotic  chases, cardboard characters,  a tacked on  ending   Why bother to continue to write run-of-mill stuff like this, Mr  Crichton should just stick to script writing
I really expected this book to be to physics what Jurassic Park was to genetics   failed badly  is just a medieval story with some 21st century insight   was almost a waste of time
Gosh, I am only 15 years old  I couldn't put this book down, I was so amazed at how cleverly written this book was  I enjoy Michael Crichton's books for their true scientific facts,  is great to know that the author  actually knows what he is talking about, by far I think this book is  Crichton's best!br  you liked this book, check out: The Fabric of  Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes  Its Implications by David  Deutsch This is like a Non-Fiction version of this book
This book stated off with such potential,  then just fell flat on its face  The posibilities with the quantum foam  multi-verse idea were amazing, the reality was a book written simply to become a movie  He has  clearly recognized the fact that his name alone sells,  that is good  enough to for him  I would say check this one out from the library, maybe   enough people hit him  his wallet then he would write the quality  stuff that made him  the first place  I would not recommend this book
I purchased this book because of the allure its premise held for me After completing , I felt that its premise  its promise were not fulfilled Indeed,  makes for a better screenplay  movie than a novel, especially the last half of the novel where the three graduate students try to escape  from Crichton's version of the temple of doom  Character development is  virtually non-existent, with the possible exception of Marek  The medieval  knights (the bad guys) also lack any real dimension  Professor Johnston  started out interesting, but eventually became a prop for the various  action scenes which went on ad-infinitum  The high points of the novel for  me were the opening moments of the protagonists arrival at Castelgard   1357, which included a lovely sense of medieval atmosphere  For example,  the lack of ambient sound which we have become accustomed to  the 20th  century, the scent of the air  the utter blackness of night The lowest  points of the novel for me were anything related to time machines  At the  end of the novel, Crichton admonishes us against believing that we are  superior to our medieval forbears I agree with him but I do not believe  that the likes of Sir Oliver  Sir Guy supports his case  One need only  to visit the Cloisters museum  NY, with its beautiful Gregorian chant  ever present  the background  NY,  the various castles of the period  located  England &amp; France to appreciate how wonderful this  civilization truly was  many respects I think  would be unfair of us  to expect the novels of Crichton  most other contemporary novelists to  approach the beauty  quality of a &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot;  a  &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, especially  this &quot;dumbed down&quot;  society of sitcoms  MTV However, a few of us still remain who expect  better  PS: For a first hand account of life  the fourteenth century,  purchase Chaucer's &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;  Its is a better read
TIMELINE, despite its intriguing opening, cannot escape inevitable comparisons to THE DOOMSDAY BOOK by Connie Willis, a Hugo-  Nebula-award winning novel on the subject of time-traveling graduate students stuck   the Middle Ages  While Willis was able to generate suspense  about  fifteen different ways at once, Crichton is stuck with a plot outline that  is heavily reminiscent of JURASSIC PARK  details that amount to little  more than a bloodier Connecticut Yankee  King Arthur's Court  His lack  of interest  creating vivid characters a reader can care about  particularly hurts this story, for some reason   you liked this, then  DOOMSDAY BOOK will blow your socks off
Once again, Dr Crichton has turned out a book he seems to have only edited,  apparently didn't personally writebr Read ,  you will find that the writing style changes frequently  The book only occasionally  shows a Crichton-ish twist of plotbr Also, the story is very bizarre   often incredible (even  you grant the basic premise of time travel)    much of  reads like a bad screenplaybr But who can blame him?   I were  as rich as he, I'd stop writing, too!
I thoroughly enjoyed TIMELINE Although some of the details needed to be read more than once to grasp, I found  fascinating I believe that Michael Crichton does a wonderful job of taking a lot of detail  making   interesting I haven't read any of his books that I haven't liked on  some level I find writers who can incorporate such detail into a story  amazing I couldn't put this book down once I started Maybe not completely  realistic, but then  is fiction, right?
Crichton has ever been my favorite author His books are scientifically researched for their &quot;basic&quot; accuracy (he has a bibliography  his fictional books!) -- when  comes to the science, facts  such used  to support his storybr  this book he finally addresses one of my life  long interests -- time travel  this story time travel become possible  through quantum physics  is not true time travel as  is actually  dimensional travel Nor is  true dimensional travel, as the travellers  are &quot;recreated&quot; at the destination, rather than just travelling  therebr  this book the focus is on an mega-company called ITC that is  researching this time travel  at the same time, funding archealogical  research into an area they are time traveling to!br However, there are  problems  the archealogy professor is stuck back  the past  a team  is sent to rescue him, only to get stuck there themselves! Once there, they  must survive  the archaic deadly 14th century France!br Meanwhile,   present day, the time travel center suffers a major disaster  things  must be fixed to allow those  the past to return, should they be able to  survive, get all together  the same place   the right place -- to  come back  is a race, literally, against timebr I can't wait for the  movie
What a great idea for a book, but - unlike most of his other novels - what a poorly executed product  Crichton is the fiction novel's master of scientific research,  up to now has been superb,  my opinion, at  translating cutting edge science for the layman via his usually  entertaining narrative (Case  point: his vivid explanations describing  the redundancies of airplane technology  Airframe have put my air travel  fears to bed forever -  I have flown internationally at least once a  week for the past ten years)   This problem with Timeline is just that the  science is too abstract for the average person (okay, maybe just me), but  even  you get past that the characters are preposterously dull  series  of events predictable  I hate to say this, as I have so much respect for  MC, but this novel does  fact seem to have been written with a film   mind ( even charactersGwyneth Paltrow as Kate since she portayed a  young boy  Shakespear  Love, etcetc)  Michael, get back to your roots  - forget Hollywood  write with the brilliance you showed us  The Great  Train Robbery!
This book moves a little fast  There's something missing, be  more scientific fact,  more history, I can't place    any event, this book combined two of my passions: medieval european history   geneticstime travel  Chrichton really does know his stuff,  has an  immense bibliography which acts as a testament to how committed he was to  giving his readers the truth, about both facets, the science  the  history  My quibble lies  the impression I got after reading : there's  something he's not telling us  There's more to this  But, this is a  very well-written book,  I would reccomend  to someone who likes  science  history,  has trouble finding a book that satisfies both  interests  But read this  you have time on your hands: 's HUGE
A) I'm a fan of Crichton's books  B) I like historical fiction  C) I enjoy medieval history D) I was disappointed by this book  The reason is because  was just too far-fetched  Traveling back  time through a time  machine?  Unfortunately this was just a spiffed up scientific version of  Bill  Ted's Excellent Adventure  I guess that's not really fair since   is evident that he did a lot of good research  But throughout the book  I just kept picturing Bill  Ted   You can compare this book with  Jurrasic Park  that each of them are based on an impossible premise  I  read Jurassic Park long before  became popular as a book  a movie  I  loved that book because  almost seemed &quot;believable&quot;  Timeline  was just the opposite,  I felt  took away from an otherwise pretty  good story  I think  almost would have been better  they would have  just stumbled onto some way of time travel instead of giving us all of that  implausible scientific jargon about why  works
I haven't actually finished Timeline yet, so my review is based on the first two thirds of the book  I've read worse books, but this one is far from good  By biggest problem is that there does not appear to be a single  character (with the possible exception of Kate) to care about  All of them  are stick figures--no past, no future, just filling a hole  the plot   Also, there's lots of techno-babble about parallel universes, blah, blah,  blah   becomes mind-numbing without being convincing  But I'll finish  the book  I'm just hopeful I'll remember this book when Crichton publishes  his next one  Excellent Crichton books like the Andromeda Strain seem to  exist  another universe--the one where the writing is convincing  the  peril seems real Sigh
Seemed to be quite predictable  totally unbelievable, not just the science stuff but the super getaways as well
This was a very good book, plain  simple  had action, adventure,  science From Quantum Theory To Jousting, I highly recommend this work of art!
Though some may pick nits with Crichton for not beefing up the suspense,  thickening up the book  general, I found this to be a truely enjoyable  totally readable book  There was just enough of everything to keep me  interested, but not too much  any one area to bore me  This is unique  achievement for the 'best selling' author crowd, who are usually so full of  themselves,  sales worthy, that they are no longer editedbr Overall,  this is an excellent read for the time travel sf fan,  better still for  the medieval history buff (with a bit thrown  for those with interest   the possibilities of quantum mechanics  though not fully based   substantiated evidence, here)br  telling the story of a group of hapless  current day time travelers, who have a bit of a mission gone awry  the  mid 1300's  western France, Crichton introduces the reader to lots of  nuances of medieval life  You get to find out a bit about English-French  relations  the region, the hows  whys of tournaments, lots of bits on  the technology of the time (particularly about the uses of water power, a  bit about tanning,  quite an interesting bit about gunpowder  early  cannons)  There are also some interesting tacts on social interrelations  between nobility  commoners (including why there actually were knights,  why the commoners hated them,  why the knights hated the commoners right  back);  there's some interesting little bits about why one should never  underestimate the powers  motivations of a woman, regardless of her  official position  the schema of thingsbr , for those of you with a  streak of malice towards Bill Gates,  anyone who comes off a lot like  him, the portrayal  ultimate fate of the Gatesian character,  the  'present' time line of the book, will leave you feeling quite  satisfiedbr Crichton is an excellent weaver of story  this novel  I  didn't see most twists coming until I was nearly on top of them  (, I'm  usually pretty good at spotting them)hem  (, I'm  usually pretty good at spotting them)
The Author's investigations into quantum time travel,  into 14th Century France were very interesting  Creighton always goes to great lengths  his research  his novels, (Airplanes, Diseases, Eastern  Customs, Etc)br My problem came with the action sequences  I'd have an  easier time believing  quantum foam than I would believing that these  20th Century time travelers could defeat 14th Century Knights  hand to  hand combat      Great script for a suspenseful thriller movie, but not  what Creighton Fans are used to
Excellent book, couldn't put  down  Classic Crichton style writing with great facts  details entwined into a compeling story, with a not so classic ending for Crichton  A great story to take you away from the daily  grind  into one of Crichton's worlds  Get  enjoy
I enjoyed the book very much,  Crichton once again shows off his technical know how  research abilities  The book is very interesting  the beginning is excellent, bringing you right into the book   Unfortunately, the middle gets very muddled, using too many characters   dragging out the actions of the main characters  Also, I felt like I was  reading a Hardy Boys book because the main characters were constantly very  close to being killed by the bad guys  The ending of the book is so boring   made the book almost not worth reading  After I finished the book I  felt as  there were a few pages missing  I recommend this book for fans  of Crichton, time travel enthusiasts,  fans of medeival history   Otherwise, save your money
I bought Timeline because I enjoyed earlier (ok much earlier) books by Michael Crichton Unfortunately the book is mindless drool from a once competent writer As a science fiction story, the novel violates the basic  rule of science fiction: One may posit any universe but the pleasure comes  from watching the plot develop consistent with that universe br As a  science fiction story, the novel makes much of quantum foam  how the  characters are traveling to an alternate universe, not time traveling   our universe The discovery of anachronistic artifacts, from travels to the  past,  an archaeological dig violates this almost immediately The later  half of the book is then dominated by a countdown clock (as chapter titles)  that ignores the fact that one of the advantages of time travel is not  being bound by time br As a novel, one expects character development   interaction After a desultory attempt to initially define characters, no  such development occurs Except for gender specific pronouns, the  characters might as well be pokeman characters caught  a metronome  sequence of peril  rescue After a series of events that would have any  normal two twenty-somethings of the opposite sex doing  like rabbits (  at least thinking of ), Crichton's characters scarcely  interactbr Overall this is a twelve martini read -- you'd better have  crushed any semblance of consciousness to read this book
Let's face  Michael Chrichton is never going to win the Nobel prize for literature  But for pure escapist reading, he's hard to top   who but Chrichton could make scientific  technological subjects not only  interesting, but even fun, for all us technophobes out there?  TIMELINE  (complete with a bibliography containing 80 references on the Middle Ages   ten on parallel worlds) tells a story of a group of scientists who step  into a time machine  travel back to France  the 1300's to rescue a  friend who preceded them  got stuck,  a world which proves to be a far  more violent  frightening place than Geoffroy  Christine de Pizan ever  wrote about  They have 37 hours to find their friend  get him   themselves safely back to the present  The ensuing day  a half turns  out to be a typical Chrictonian roller-coaster ride  we know pretty much  how  will turn out (, yes, the villain gets his,  a good job, too),  but  you take the book for what  is, 's fun  enjoyable   some  of his references are definitely worth pursuing (check out Michio Kaku's  'Hyperspace', for one)  Say what you want about Chrichton's deficits as a  writer, he gets you wanting to know more about what he writes about,   that, by itself, makes him a good read
Based on the Jacket review I expected this to be an entertaining story What a disapointment! br There has to be some logic  rational to the sequence of events  a good story This story ignors these elementary  requirements The story was confused  bewildering I did finish the book  hoping that there was somthing worth while to be discovered Nothing came  of my effortbr I stongly suggest that the author  publisher of this  travesty do not rely on past performanmce to justify inflicting the public  with such trash
Neither Crichton's best work nor an outstanding displaced-persons story, this is still a fun read  Don't start this book expecting a suspenseful tale  a superlative plot, you won't find either one   What you will find  is a quick, entertaining story  Crichton's usual attention to detail, both  historically  scientifically are the true selling points -- although I  did notice one inconsistency that was never fully explained   The movie of  this book ( there will be one,  was obviously written with that  intent) will likely be better than the book itself
This book was interesting  picturing 14C France  its constant warfare; however the novel's constant explanations of quantum theory  the various scientific aspects of these theories were difficult for a  layman to understand  The people  the book were cut-out figures   there was so much coinicidence that I laughed out loud Sometimes  seemed  to be written for the movies, especially the action scenes I found the  story line fantastical  the historical picture of 14C life intriguing  but I wish that Michael Crichton had spent more time developing character   motivation  For instance, Professor Johnston, the most intelligent  person  the book, as referred to by the other characters, was constantly  described as expressionless  stoical, not the best characteristics for  the man whose rescue is the reason behind the time travel  the first  place  The action heroes  heroines barely related to one another   the final chapter seemed to come out of nowhere
Timeline is my first foray into the literary world of Mr Crichton  I came out feeling both mildly impressed  completely disgusted br I was impressed at the obvious effort that Mr Crichton has put into researching  several Quantum Mechanics theories as well as his attempt at presenting  Medieval France  a historically accurate manner I even felt he did a  good job of minimizing the amount of poetic license taken  the building  of the Timeline framework Unfortunately the excellent effort put into the  background was completely undermined due to the fact that the plot  the  characters are both weak  predictablebr  the first half of the novel,  I was able to overlook the superficial nature of the characters  (caricatures would be more accurate) However, by the middle of the novel,  the characters become so stereotypical that I found  harder  harder to  continue reading the bookbr Marek (the hero), is so good,  so perfect,  that he can do no wrong He is the typical &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; type  who goes swashbuckling through merry ol' France, saves the fairy princess,   triumphs over evil Even more pathetic, however, was Chris (The  buffoon) who always manages to make  through despite his stupidity   clumsiness By the third time he had fallen, hit his head,  dropped his  weapon  a time of need, I got to the point where i was cheering on the  villain hoping he would put this character out of my misery The rest of  the characters are just as superficial  inanebr The plot was equally  disappointing  was obviously written as a movie-script rather than a  novel From the very moment they land back  Medieval France they are  involved  a neverending series of chase scenes from which they narrowly  escape (of course) despite their bumbling idiocy  due to bold machismo   was so poorly written  so predictable I was skipping ten to fifteen  pages at a time until the latest narrow escape was over  ostensibly the  plot would pickup for a page  two before the next chase scene beganbr I  would not recommend this book to anyone other than an avid Crichton fan   fact,  someone wants my copy they can have  for free I would hate for  Mr Critchton to make money on this dog because  might encourage him to  write another like 
Though this book was not amazing compared to his previous works,  is still a pretty amazing novel I have to give Crichton credit for making subjects as difficult as quantum physics understandable  also gives  readers a chance to learn about medieval life without using boring  textbooks br I think this book is definitely worth reading
I was very disappointed (would like my money back!) MC took a guaranteed winner of a story  managed to bore me to death with his shallow characters  predictable plot
Part of the thrill  reading Michael Crichton's books, is the ease by which he explains high concepts, such as quantum foam  medieval France  this instance  I found myself involved with the characters -- more so  than  his previous books  I can't wait to see the movie, which is the  highest praise one can give to a book of this genre
Chrichton's &quot;Timeline&quot; continued my constant passion for medieval history  Once again, he has eloquently given a thrilling story while supporting  with extensive knowledge  As a medieval historian, my  hat  heart wants to thank Michael for this awesome novel  I didn't want   to end!   We can only ask: Will  be made into a movie?
 the basic plot of modern historians going back  time to Medieval France, 's because you remember Mark Twain's famous &quot;Connecticut Yankee  King Arthur's Court&quot; The resemblance ends immediately  because Crichton makes  a point of honour to be excruciatingly accurate  about the 14th Century to the best of our current knowledge Don't worry,  though Crichton is the man who has taught us everything from what to do   a male gorilla threatens you to what goes on  an airliner factory He  strike the right balance between intelligent  thrilling Realism has  always been the man's fort  the plot seems familiar when you read the  first chapter, 's because the structure of the book very much resembles  Jurassic Park This brings us to inevitable comparisons Perhaps 's  because I've immersed myself  theoretical physics for the mere mortals,  such as myself, but unlike Jurassic Park, there were no major scientific  shocks for me The jacket implies surprising technological breakthroughs  Nothing about the science surprised me While the history fascinated me,  the plot  science struck me as a variation on a theme,  less  successful than the original
As usual, Chricton's novel was a very entertaining read I would recommend  to anyone who wants to read a quick novel you won't want to put down!
Michael Crichton has been one of the masters of the science thriller  TIMELINE is fun, but  lacks what has made Crichton's work mesmerizing  the past: explanations that make sensebr This is not to say that the  science that underlies TIMELINE is inexplicable  Michael Moorcock   Douglas Adams have both explained quantum physics  the concept of the  multiverse very clearly  to great advantage  their works of fantasy   humor, respectively  Does Crichton assume that we've read these?  I  doubt ; he shouldn't  Readers of Crichton  readers of Moorcock   Adams, et al, are a breed apart under normal circumstances  's just  that travelling through time back into an alternate middle ages may appeal  as a topic to those who normally don't read Crichton   one does not  immediately think of Crichton's works   the same genre as ARMY OF  DARKNESS which explores the same basic subject matter with bravadobr Once  Crichton gets to the middle ages, TIMELINE is a lot of fun  The intrigue  of the conflict between England  France  the lack of  &quot;media&quot; as we know  today is truly entertaining  Especially  intriguing is a tale that could stand apart from the novel as a short story  relative to a knight who has gone insane  guards &quot;the green  chapel&quot;  br But Crichton's narrative breaks down because he hasn't  gone to his usual fastidious detail to explain how people travel from one  universe to another, yet can still excavate artifacts that were left behind   another universe  this onebr For those who are looking for Crichton  at his best  a science based thriller, the novel (not the film version!)  SPHERE shows his capabilities admirably as does JURASSIC PARK  But  TIMELINE is no more than a pleasant diversion, not what  could have been  had Crichton taken the time to explain how we got therebr The best example  of Crichton's flaw here is a scene where the &quot;corporation&quot; which  hasdeveloped quantum teleportation for realistic recreation fields  questions from anthropologists who ask about going back to the past   changing the present  The answer?  &quot;You just can't, that's all&quot;   br Try Moorcock's series of novels about the &quot;Eternal Champion&quot;  - especially the CHRONICLES OF CORUM,  Adams' DIRK GENTLY'S HOLISTIC  DETECTIVE AGENCY for truly satisfying science interwoven with fiction   Crichton leaves you wanting
I was enjoying this as a light holiday weekend entertaining read until when I came to page 209 Sir Daniel shows Chris that  the distance, Arnaut de Cervole's company is encamped &quot;no more than fifteen miles  distant&quot; Miles? MILES? Since when was &quot;miles&quot;  the  occitan vocabulary? Now I'm wondering  I should even bother finishing   Sorry, but this slip just looses  for me Who edits this stuff anyway?
Most other Crichton novels immerse you into a fictional world, be  dinosaurs  a ship from the future  the bottom of the ocean, this one immerses you into 14th century life,  shows   al of its stark  truths, all while an action adventure story twists  turns Crichton  wonderfully blends the topics of Quantum Physics, 21st century corporate  politics,  life  the 1300's, all while commenting on todays society I  enjoyed the fact that I got a much more realistic  detailed view of life   the past then I've seen  history books  you like that kind of  hidden education, I suggest you read Airframe, I am an avation buff, so   was nice to see a book put alot of how a major aircraft company has to  manuver  todays inaccurate media blitz society,  also how the  airlineFAANTSBManufacturer combination functionbr  you liked any of  chritions's past works, paticulary sphere  Airframe, I think you will  love timeline -  is the best book I've read
Timeline is the third disappointing novel  a row from Crichton There was simply no suspense  the novel at all Scientific facts  conjecture can only do so much when unaccompanied by at least some tension Every  sword sparks, every horse sighs, winnies  snorts  everybody escapes  huge knights  the knick of timebr  was a chore to finish, skip the  book, skip the movie
I found this book very entertaining, but difficult to read at times where the visualazation should have been put into greater detail  left certain things unexplained  never backtracked to clear  up  was a fun read  though,  I would recommend 
This is a quick read  a fictional account that incorporates quantum mechanics, strange &quot;bedfellows&quot;, corporate greed  a little histroy thrown  for good measure Actually, the historical observations  make the book most interesting  Don't take  seriously,though, just enjoy  !
Not his best work  Wonder why he picked Medieval France  not somewhere  else Maybe I missed   the rambling  you want to read a wonderful  book about time travel read &quot;Time  Again&quot; by Jack Finney br I  also think  is a &quot;movie between covers&quot;  will make a great  action flick A cross between Star Trek  Braveheart  &quot;Beam me  back, Scotty&quot; Reserve  at your local library, don't waste your  money,  buy &quot;Time  Again&quot; instead
The premise of this book is imaginative  interesting  starts off very well However, this books turns into a history lesson of the 14th century period  is predictable  uninteresting after the mid point  There is no doubt that Mike did his homework on two subjects:  Quantum  physics  medieval times, but he uses too much research  this book  which takes away from the characters  the plot He could have done so  much with this premise, but at the end of the book,  leaves the reader  saying, &quot;why bother?&quot;
I agree with the other reviewers who thought the book had a good premise, but fell way short when trying to live up to the Crichton name  Descriptions of the knights, ruins, etc where terrific, the science behind  time travel will fly with those who don't know a bit about science,  the  &quot;here vs there&quot; plot got tiresome  For those who want to buy ,  borrow  from a friend  take  out at the library
Timeline is an exciting, riveting tale that masterfully weaves technology  history together Quantum physics provides an intriguing base for the storyline set  the present  14th centurybr I enjoyed the characters   the idea of traveling to the 14th century Although the reader will  develop ideas that were not presented  the book, (such as: why not send  an armed Marine unit back for a rescue?) this enhances the novel by  stimulating your own imaginationbr This book was a page turner from  beginning to end A great gift idea for the holidays!
Sorry, but I was distracted throughout my read by a gaping hole  the plot relating to the timing of their arrival  relation to the first person's arrival True, there would have been no book  they had been  directed to a more appropriate time to save their fellow travler; however,  one wonders how this escaped the editors  While the plot had lots of  action  was screenplay action contrived to reinvent Raiders of the Lost  Ark where there is a problem at every turn  I enjoyed Crichton's other  books more
Wel,, I started   I finished    I was disappointed with the story  the characters  Exciting at the beginning, you soon lose yourself  the perils of the hansom  beautiful characters lost   Medevil times, along the ranting of the rich company owner with his slick  lawyer  ex-military jack of all trades  Fell short of being a real  great book, but a fun read  you are looking for something to waste the  afternoon with
I was quite disppointed by this book  A long time Crichton Book, I found this book to be rushed  based on a formula  His intent with this book, as with many others, was to write a book that would be a blockbuster  moviebr However, there was zero character development  his basic story  had very serious holes    He wrote too many cop-outs  avoided the  serious time travel issues  Furthermore, he often relies on illustrations  to describe a scene, because he is unable  unwilling to describe   through words  Save your $20 on the book,  spend  to take a date to  the movie
This book starts out interestingly enough, but the plot quickly falls apart into a series of chases  near death escapes that are boring  completely unbelievable (for about 300 pages) The characters are flat   almost seem to be cartoons I think the book's premise was a good idea, but  Crighton did not pull  off Will probably make a good mindless, bloody  movie, though
Ever since the Andromeda Strain, I've been impressed with Michael Crichton's ability to hook the reader very early with a tremendously creative plot line  Timeline is certainly no exception  Even though time  travel tends to be an overdone theme  science fiction, Crichton's initial  plot setup is intriguing  His pseudo-scientific explanations of how  quantum theory makes time travel possible is ingenious,  his  well-researched portrayal of everyday life  feudal Europe is full of  fascinating details  But I found my interest waning as his time-traveling  trio battled armies of knights, monks  various thugs; crossed   re-crossed a river several times, swung from ropes  rafters,   generally performed superhuman feats  countless narrow escapes, all  within a 37-hour period  Frankly, I became disoriented  disinterested  as the escapades became more  more preposterous, especially by his lead  character (Here I come to save the day  ) Andre Marek  A good read but  be prepared to swallow a large grain of salt  the process
I am absolutely amazed that this book was written by the same author that wrote Congo,  Jurassic Park  's great to read something that has a good plot, filled with interesting information  good characters  The  message of the mathematician  Jurassic park was brilliant  My immediate  impression of this book (still struggling to finish ) is that this was  written to be a movie,  nothing else  Really disappointed
 premise  plotting, &quot;Timeline&quot; is astonishingly like an episode of the TV show &quot;Sliders&quot;br As a big Crichton fan, but an even bigger fan of time travel fiction, this book is not half as clever   original as Crichton seems to think,  pales  comparison to Finney´s  &quot;Time  Again&quot;  Koontz´s &quot;Lightning&quot;  Partly that  is because Crichton refuses to take advantage of all of the opportunities  afforded by time travel, copping out by saying that people aren´t really  time traveling but are jumping to nearly identical alternative universes  (ie Sliders), but still allowing one of the characters to send a message  through time to the original universe, thus undermining the whole  premisebr Indeed, his explanation for how the sliders, oops, I mean time  travelers can jump forward  then back is so torturously elliptical   contrived (requiring yet other nearly identical alternative universes to  step   make the journeys possible) that he would have been better off  not bothering to try to ground this  current physics at allbr As a  scientist, I see this as the first of Crichton´s books to fail the test of  internal scientific consistency, even within the framework of the book  itselfbr Still, bad Crichton is better than most  Four stars for  entertainment, two stars for qualityoriginality
The book started out promising, with a realistic approach to &quot;time-travel&quot;, but travels downhill from there There is no character development  the time travel sequence--people come  go  arbitrarily, the reader never is clear on who the characters are,  why  they are after the time travelers  seems Mr Crichton wrote this book  with Hollywood looking over his shoulder, just waiting to grab  out of  his hands  turn  into a screen play
Well  you are expecting Andromeda Strain  Jurrasic Park ( even Sphere) you will probably be dissapointed  The science  Timeline is weak at best,  you never really buy the &quot;alternate universe to the  past&quot; bit (not to mention how they explain the way the team gets  reconstituted on the other end)  The history is a little better  the  story is rather exciting from an action standpoint  br I kept thinking  about &quot;Doomsday Book&quot; by Connie Willis as a much better rendition  of an amazingly similar theme  plot line (ie history researcher going  back  time to the middle ages, having technical problems, having to use  their history knowledge to survive, etc)   you read Timeline, read  Doomsday Book as well for a nice comparison
Well I guess the author did his homework on 14th century France, no denying that,  I suppose he read lots of arcane books  articles  the learned scientific journals  consulted with some high-priced  physicists on all the quantum mechanical terms  theories he splashes  around  this book, but all that does not save us from a historical  cartoon with fatal flaws, including, but not limited to, two dimensional  characters that could have been imported from the 10 cent comic books I  read as a kid, a telegraphed ending,  a significant faux pas having to  do with water shielding (necessary to prevent people who are sent through  &quot;quantum foam&quot; to another time from having reassembly errors)  being required  the present, however, very interestingly not being  necessary when the poor graduate students are sent back  reassembled   the 14th century ( was ? ) Maybe reassembly errors can somehow explain  how these presumably wimpy academics suddenly turned into sword wielding  superheros complete with the politically correct female protagonist
&quot;Timeline&quot; is not great literature  But,  is great entertainment  superior Science Fiction  Come to think of  tho, Isn't that what great literature ultimately is?br Its been suggested that  &quot;Timeline&quot; was written with the flicks  mind  I have a strong  suspicion that the movie script was completed at the same time as the book,   a buyer was camping at the front doorbr This is a book that crys out  for movie treatment,   may be a bigger blockbuster than &quot;Jurrasic  Park&quot;br Jerry
I thought this book was very exciting  I finished the entire book  one day   is a swashbuckling tale that is combined with small amounts of science fiction  The author uses the sci-fi to transport his characters to  a time of knights  damsels   is a very enjoyable adventure
But not as good as I'd expect from Crichton  However, that may have a lot to do with my not being very interested  Medeival history  IMHO, there was too much action  not enough science involved  the plotbr I'd put  this at the bottom of a ranking of Crichton's novels, but still worth  reading for entertainment
I really disliked this book, but finished  anyway, hoping  would payoff  would make a blockbuster movie, a la Jurassic Park Lots of detailed physical action, zero character development Definitely my least  favorite Crichton book
Some people have given this book a bad review below, but I'm afraid they've missed the point by a very long shot  This isn't meant to have character depth  a fancy plot, like say, the very good Robert Goddard   's escapism, pure  simple  The plot is breathless, as the characters  go from one problem to the next,   makes for a thrilling, enjoyable  read  Kind of the equivalent of watching a great Hollywood movie     has the usual Crichton hallmarks of teaching you about this  that   br Highly recommended for when you just want something that's damn exciting  , cliched as the phrase might be, a true Page Turner
This book is not as tight as some of Crichton's other accomplishments   The story was never very believable  There was suspense, but  was almost cliched  What he did do well was cause me to pause  reconsider what we  really know about how people lived back  time
Michael Crichton does his research   &quot;Timeline,&quot; he thoroughly researches a time period  the 1300's,  to make sure that we know this, Crichton includes an extensive bibliography at the end of the  book  He also goes into some esoteric jargon concerning quantum physics,  which I admit I barely understood  &quot;Timeline&quot; is about an  eccentric genius who comes up with an idea that enables his scientists to  &quot;fax&quot; people to another time period  Most of the book takes  place  the 1300's  France  Since I like history, I enjoyed the  esoteric details about life  the Middle Ages  However, Crichton pays  little attention to character  plot development  this novel  &quot;Timeline&quot; has several serious flaws  The characters are  one-dimensional The plot makes little sense   is like an &quot;Indiana  Jones&quot;  &quot;Perils of Pauline&quot; escapade,  which our heroes  are  constant danger, but somehow just manage to stay alive  (unbelievably)  The villains are completely nasty, with no gray areas  However, since Crichton does have some storytelling skills, I did want to  see how  would all turn out  the end   the future, Crichton should  pay more attention to character  plotting  The best research doesn't  make up for a novel without the basic elements of interesting   well-developed characters  a carefully constructed plot
I felt like I was reading a screen play
I have seen some very negative reviews of Timeline  This is honestly one of the best books that I have read  quite some time  I agree that Crichton side-stepped a few hairy issues with using quantum phyisics as a  time travel mechanism, but this is a novel folks -  you need hardcore  information take a look at the bibliography at the back of the book!    Crichton did his homework!br This was a great read; I cannot recommend   highly enough!
Michael Critchon should just have included the shooting directions for the movie  this book  been done with  The scientific premise of the story is interesting, but the book is populated with characters about whom   is impossible to get involved - his &quot;Bill Gates&quot; character is  devoid of any human qualities whatsoever  the rest of the crew is so  &quot;by the book&quot; they might just as well have been named  &quot;Character One&quot;  &quot;Character Two&quot; Look for the movie  to be out shortly  the action not too far behind
I've read a whole bunch of his books,  once again, Michael Crichton took me to a whole other world  Yeah, some of the stuff was a little hokey, but all  all I thought that the book was a fun adventurescience  fictionhistorical novel  He did a good job  explaining all of the  scientific language, which is not always the case  his books  I would  definately recomend this book, especially  you are a Crichton fan   Enjoy!
 should be titled waste of Timeline!br Ok, yes  is easy to be a critic but, I can't beleive that I read the whole thing br He must have gotten tired of writing  decided to just end  The ending was horrid There  were pages of where  might get going but, no I only wish I had not  wasted my time on   br Oh  the plot line of evil capitalist against  do good academics is so droll Save your money  your time  buy  something else, you will be glad you did!
As with most of his books that I ever read, I found the story engrossing,  the book difficult to put down  The characters were interesting enough as well, but I felt that something was missing  I didn't have that  &quot;WOW&quot; feeling after I was done as I did  with &quot;Rising  Sun&quot;,  &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;  's as  he just cranked that  one out without that little something extra  I would recommend this book  though, as  is better than average  's a good book from a man who has  written great books  I suppose Mike has  like that!    were being  graded, i'd give  a B-  35 stars  I could!
With a different plot like always, he came with more new ideas People love his ideas The book opened  21'st century I loved the way Chrichton describes each  every detail I have read all of his books except  &quot;A case of need&quot; I could not wait for this book to come to the  library I reserved this book online so that I could get  on time Great  way to go
This book started off wonderfully,  I thought the author had returned to his previous abilities to be fascinating  suspenseful at the same time  However, as soon as the book progresses to medieval time,  turns  into a cartoon  I completely lost interest then, skimming the last 100  pages  What a disappointment but I'm sure  will be a blockbuster movie  which I'll be sure to miss Don't waste your money  Another example of a  popular author's work going downhill
This book is a very good read  As is typical of Crichton, pace is very important,  he even gives you a &quot;game clock&quot; by which to judge the progress of the characters through the story  His ability to  effortlessly jump between three  more related, but separate, story lines  adds to the tension -- like a commercial break as the potential  game-winning pass is  the air between the quarterback  the intended  receiver  The &quot;contemporary&quot; technological aspects of the story  actually pale by comparison to the medieval technological aspects    Crichton's depiction of early-14th Century arms  man is accurate, I  think  will surprise many readers  The one thing that left me a little  empty was his allowing the &quot;time travelling&quot; heroes  heroine  the benefits of 21st Century technology, not just to get to the past (for  which they obviously need the modern technology), but while they are there  (where at least one of the group does his orher best to disdain all things  not of the 14th Century)   this respect, I found this book less  satisfying than one I read at least a decade ago of which I was constantly  reminded while reading &quot;Timeline&quot;: Connie Willis's excellent  &quot;The Doomsday Book&quot;  As  &quot;Timeline,&quot; the heroine of  &quot;The Doomsday Book&quot; is a historian (a graduate student, as I  recall -- Like Marek, Kate,  Chris  this book) who travels back to the  early-14th Century (England, as opposed to Crichton's France)  must  overcome challenges undreamed of  our modern world  Crichton does a  better job of fleshing out the &quot;here--now&quot; part  &quot;Timeline,&quot;  also nicely interweaves art, architecture,  armaments, military strategy  tactics, politics,  religion  the  historical part of the tale  Still, I was a little surprised that his  extensive bibliography  other credits did not make mention of a book  that surely must have influenced him  some way -- unless this is simply a  case of &quot; enough monkeys sit at typewriters long enough eventually  you'll end up with Shakespeare&quot;  Somehow, I doubt   BOTTOM LINE: A  very good read; ,  you liked this book, you should also read &quot;The  Doomsday Book&quot; by Connie Willis  (, no, I am neither related to  nor an agent for Connie Willis)
HG Wells meets Barbara Cartland meets JRR Tolkien  The only thing new about this book was the quantum physics stuff  I hate to admit that I have read one too many romance novels  my time  , this book is just a  scientific romance novel There are some very intense chapters  But, I  also got to the point where I said, &quot;Just how many times can these  people escape unscathed?&quot;  There were far too many Save for a beach  book   is a mindless read  not worth a lot of extra effort
Reading this book is akin to reading a movie script Each scene is set out like a movie scene with the characters placed  position  then &quot;action&quot; being called The narractive is simple  the  characters lacking any depth at allbr I love inplausible action novels   movies as long as contradictions  logic are not apparent   Timeline we have a CEO of a high tech compnay struggling to obtain funds to  continue his Quantum time travel research Meanwhile his company is sitting  on the best voice recognition hardware seen  the fastest computers   existence Either of these products, which are used by the ITC staff  the  book, would be worth hundreds of billions of dollars  marketed to the  world Yet the CEO struggles to obtain a couple of billion from corporate  backers DUH!br This book could have been so much better The basic concept  is fascinating but unfortunately  feels as  we have the screen play  before the book instead of vice versa
This books starts kind of slow but once the action starts  seems to snow ball into an all out adventure  Chrichton has shown his true &quot;Jurassic&quot; colors once again  this latest thriller The only  thing separating this bok from the Box Office is 'Time' Grab  now,  though, because you'll want to be one of those saying &quot;the book was  better&quot;!
I found this book &quot;Timeline&quot; a page turner worth reading  you're the type of person who doesn't read much I was amazed at how fast I was done with the book An excellent book but its ending doesn't have a hidden &quot;moral to the story&quot; The characters didn't have any  character either But all  all Crichton kept me  suspense
Although I do respect everybody's opinion, I have no clue as to why some people disliked this book so much  Hey, I am not a critic, I can only tell you that I found  extremely entertaining,  that I loved  from  beginning to end  Besides the plot  fast paced action of the last 23's  of the book, I specially enjoyed Crichton's portrayal of life  the middle  ages,  forces you to see the present from a different perspective
Timeline kept me up all night readingI throughly enjoyed this bookI love time travel &amp; quantum physics is very interesting as well as very technicalI learned a lot about science &amp; humanitiesWhen one reads  this book one can tell that Critchon researched his subject a great deal  may be fiction but  seems so real  possibleI wholeheartedly recommend  this bookOne of the best I have read lately
Michael Crichton's main talent is to appeal to the adolescent  all of us After dinosaurs, he gives us knights  not-so-shining armor,  a dash of time travel Three stars for the book--muddled science  muddled  action included-- a fourth for this knack of indulging our fantasies A  screenplay with some soapbox pieces on quantum theory  the role of  history  our lives, Timeline has the two-(one-?)dimensional characters we  know from his earlier works But they are sympathetic  don't get  the  way of the fun  frolic of swordfights, jousting  exploring secret  passages As usual, Crichton has done his homework well, packaged his ideas  with sufficient froth  delivered a highly readable  diverting romp
Timeline, is another excellent book by,Micheal Crichton The book ids about time travel  quantum physics  the bbok you go from 2000 to 14th century feudal Europe, to rescue a professor etcetcetc blah blah  blah,yadi ydai ya
I haven't read a Crichton book  a while but had seen many of the movies made from his previous novels   reading this book I felt like I was reading a future screenplay for &quot;Timeline&quot; the movie  The book  had incredible (actually impossible) feats of strength  daring by 20th  century characters  14th Century France  Many times I felt that  this  were true to form the people would most certainly be deadbut  miraculously they surviveagain  again  again  again  On a more  positive note, the book moves along at a good clip  the science behind  the technology involved  transporting the characters back to 14th century  France was intriguing  All  all I would say that this is a fun book to  read but not a mind boggling novel that keeps you thinking after your done    is pretty much mindless fun with unusual science
To be fair, I have to admit that I gave up after 100 pages  The characters are absolutely cardboard, the story is reads like an outline for a story (put some flesh on    might work)   fact, perhaps that's  what  is?  The outline for a screenplay?
Once again Michael Crichton does a bang up job entertaining the reader Loaded with factsstats(as is typically Crichton), no matter I travel extensively  therefore desire books that make the journey easier When I  read Timeline, a very long trip literally zipped by Like some previous  Crichton works we are taken to another place,time, world, but that's fine  with me The critics that tear away at Crichton's factoids, etc, are  forgetting that some of us just like to have a fun read once  a  while-- this is truly a fun read Forget the fact critics--read the book   have fun
This was a very boring, predictable book  The plot was rather implausable,  the characters (particularly the medieval characters) were not well developed at all  Crichton's attention to detail is his strength,   there was no lack  that area, but  only goes so far when  come to  holding the reader's interest  Pass on this one
Starts off intriguingly mysteriously -- discovery of a strange body  a desert  But then deteroriates into fanciful non-credibility, shallow cardboard characters  an unconvincing plot  The book does not grab you,  quite the contrary   turned into a page-turner for me:    to get through   quickly   I'm glad I bought  as an Xmas gift for someone who asked  for   I would regret having spent the money had I bought  for myself   The book will translate into a Hollywood special effects  flash-zing-bangfest, though  -- Tom Longo  Ocean City, MD

This was an exceptional book! The possibility of quantum theory, a look back into life  the 12th century combined with the profit motive of an American company made for great reading! A few surprises are added as a  bonus The view of 12th century France was the best part of the book for me  but as the main focus of the book is there is you don't like medieval times  you won't like the book Don't expect alot of character development, just a  quick pace thoughout  reads quickly is fun  makes one wonder what can  be!
I was initially captured by the premise  was excited to see MC merge  weave science  fiction  The book got off to a promising start  then  just dragged on  Unfortunately he wrote a screenplay  I had  expected to read a novel
The worst Crichton book of the 5 I've readbr The pseudo-science premise was a weak catch-all for the problems with time-travel  left  much unexplained (ie how does going into a  parallel universe change the past   the present universe?)br Characters were uncompelling  some provided  almost nothing to the story (eg the professor was no more than an excuse  to go back  time)  Way too many pages wasted on the MacGyver-like way  they repaired the time machinebr Plot was almost non-existant  Characters  were chased  hacked at  They were captured  escaped  eventually  found the secret passage, the only source of suspense ( a weak one at   that)  br The notion of time travel to medival times has so much  potential  Crichton squandors  Simon Hawke's novel &quot;Ivanhoe  Gambit&quot; is  a great example of how fun the premise can be
For example:br  1What is the rush to repair the equipment? Can rescuers not teleport back to arrival day whenever they're ready?   2How come they can figure out quantum teleportation, but cannot construct an  &quot;answering machine&quot;  strengthen a glass panel without help?    3Why can't they take guns back, but take  miniature electronics  their  ear?   4Instead of pitching to investors, why doesn't  Doniger go back   time a decade  buy microsoft?br As science fiction this screenplay is  worthless  As a remake of &quot;Conneticut Yankee&quot;  is fair I  expected more from the author of &quot;Andromeda Strain,&quot;  &quot;Terminal Man&quot;  &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;
Very ambitious, but underperforming  The idea of melding high tech with the past worked  Jurassic Park, but  does not work  Timeline  A book about quantum physics,  a book about 14th century europe would be better  than a book about both
I really enjoyed this book   The science may have some flaws, but this was a very enjoyable read    When is the sequel?
First a boring lecture on some of the more extravagent theories of time travel (which virtually all theoretical physicists still say is impossible, at least backwards), then a thoroughly daft story of modern day folk  charging around medieval France, complete with jousting knights, fair  damsels  mind-blowingly awful dialog Crichton might be able to get away  with this tosh, but hardly any one else would have got into print with   Laughable
Michael Crichton will take you to the medieval past with emerging quantum technology  You will experience chivalry  barbarity of the medieval era  The science is believable  the discription of the journey to the  past is vivid  Timeline is a riveting experience!br Timeline the movie  would only be icing on the cake
I travel quite a bit  have found that listening to tapes an enjoyable way to pass the time Michale Chrichto's novel &quot; Timeline &quot; had me glued to the head sets The plot was very interesting  orginal   had all the great ingridents, bad guys, chases, intrique, suspense,  hero's   a great ending Just super!
I read &quot;Jurrasic Park&quot; when I was 14  found  to be one of the best books I have ever read  I wonder  being 14 would have helped  the my reading of &quot;Timeline&quot;br Of course, since this is Crichton,  you never feel as  the author doesn't know what he's talking about   However, he could have done so much more with the plot then a simple  &quot;Race For Escape&quot;(He clearly has a missed opportunity when he  explains that its impossible for time travelers to have an effect on the  timeline&quot;Back to the Future&quot; does a better job!)  the  presence of the archtypal corporate villan of Robert Doniger whose only  goal is money reminds me too much of Crichton's literary pastbr So, for  these reasons, I call this book &quot;Typical Crichton&quot;   you're  looking for a quick  painless pleasure read, pick this book up    you're looking for serious historical  &quot;time travel&quot; fiction,  better keep lookingbr When I finished &quot;Jurrasic Park&quot;, I thought  &quot;There should really be  a movie version!&quot;  I'm not expecting  &quot;Timeline&quot; to be next summer's blockbusterbr Overall: A Good  Read, but Probaly Will Never Leave My Bookshelf Again
I've been reading some of these reviews about Timeline,   seems people are split on  That's amazing to me How can you not like this book? I couldn't put this book down, I think I finished  faster than any  novel I've ever read,  I read ALOT! I've rarely been so completely  engrossed  involved  a book before The descriptions of elements of  Quantum physics were fascinating  simple Mostly, I really cared for the  characters  I just loved what Chrichton did with the last chapter Maybe  that's because I felt such a close kinship with the character 'Marek' I am  a professional actor  New York  I have been jousting professionally  for seven years now Chrichton did an AMAZING job of describing what  jousting  broadsword fighting is really like Not just from a technical,  book-learned way, but from a very real  visceral sense I really have to  wonder how he knows so much about  Yeah, he might have just talked to  some of us jousters, but there were some details about what 's really  like to ride a horse with all of that equipment on, that I can't understand  how he knows 's just so intuitive From what 's like inside the  helmet, to how  feels to see someone coming at you like that, he just  totally hit the nail on the helm I wonder  he's ever tried  (I find  that kind of hard to believe, because  takes a very long time to be able  to do ) Also, from an actor's standpoint; I am someone who has studied  people's motivations  behavior intensely for many years now  I found  these character's dialogue  moment to moment actions completely  believable     This is a great, action filled book that I recommend to  everyone, be they sword-slingers  no Sir Michael Chrichton, I dip my  lance at thee Thank you!
I've just finished reading Timeline  I am glad to say that Michael Crichton is still one of the best science fiction writers of our time, easily  the same league as Clarke, Heinlein  Asimovbr An excellent  story with good character development  an impeccable sense of detail   was well-written  well-researched; 's exciting  compelling from  start-to-finish I would have read  through  one sitting  I had had  the time
This was my first experience with Mr Crichton,  now I can see why he's considered to be one of the best  his field  I enjoyed his time travel theory  was completely emerged  the plight of my heroes ( heroine)   There were a few holes, but I was more than willing ignore those  just  enjoy the ride
Michael Crichton has been disappointing me of late Did anyone actually make  through Airframe? But this is one of the better books he's written  quite a while  has a great premise  I was intrigued by his  explanation of time travel The Middle Ages is one of my favorite eras   history  I was excited about this book  was a pretty good read but I  thought his characters were too shallow I didn't really care  they found  what they were looking for  came back  not He had a really good idea,  but he took  for a walk instead of a run
the ones you love  Perhaps admire is a better word---I admired him first with the Andromeda Strain,  my respect for his talent only increased with the politically incorrect Disclosure  intelligent ethnic tension of  Rising Sun  When Michael Crichton is at the cutting edge of technological   social trends,  he is at his best  Unfortunately though,  I can't  endorse Timelinebr      The premise is brilliant  An eccentric physicist  turned billionaire finds a way to send people through time  bring them  back safely again  But after establishing the brilliant premise   getting his main characters,  a team of archeologists, to medeival France,   Timeline degenerates into a lengthy string of combat scenes,  escapes,   death defying stunts,    the process loses the intelligence of its  authorbr This may be marketable for the screen,  but for those of us who  love tight,  well researched fiction,  its not worth reading the last 200  pagesbr Sorry Michael,  love ya,  but you always hurt
I only finished this book because I've enjoyed the author's previous novels so much  This treatment of time travel had some clever technological explanations, but when you've said that, you've said  all  The characterization was poor  the plot plodded on with very little  excitement  At the end of the day, I didn't care whether they ever got  back  not  The ending was not satisfactory eitherI hope there's no  sequel coming!
 we're to believe the bibliography, Timeline is one of the most extensively researched pieces of recent fiction  Unfortunately, the resulting product is disappointingmediocre science fiction meets  dumbed-down history  The characters are shallow clones of earlier Crichton  protagonists,  the plot needs workthe last third of the book devolves  into chasing-running-hiding-chasing-running-hiding-ad infinitum  br For  better science fiction, read anything by Azimov For a more vivid image of  the Middle Ages, read The name of the Rose, by Umberto Eco  As Eco has  said, publishers underestimate the intelligence of readers  Maybe  overzealous editing caused this book to be such a shallow example of the  kind of work that Crichton is obviously capable of doing
I love books by Micheal Crichton  buy all of them I think his best were Jurassic Park  the Andromeda Strain This book is entertaining  offers some interesting insights into 13th century mores,but the science  discriptions were missing  the story was not really compelling While I  do recommend , I just wish he would write something really gripping  again
One of Crichton's best Good that he's gotten back on track after Airframe
Michael Crichton captivated me  the 70's with a little novel written while he was still  college, &quot;The Eaters of the Dead&quot;  br I liked &quot;Timeline&quot;  I think, given Crichton's penchant for  creating alternate realities, that he probably enjoyed writing this book   I certainly think he has penned better stuff-but what the heck, can't a guy  have a little fun anymore?br By the way, The &quot;The Eaters of the  Dead&quot; has been reprinted  I strongly recommend this first novel-  only to appreciate just how talented Michael was at such an early stage   his careerbr Jerry Furland, Author of &quot;Transfer-the end of the  beginning&quot;
Another marvelous work from Michael Crichton, who is one of the last great writers of true &quot;science&quot; fiction An engaging plot, a unique look into quantum physics,  an amazing look into 12th century feudal  France leaves you wondering where the science leaves off  the fiction  begins My only complaint is a slight element of predictability
No, this is not his best work  But  is worth buying  reading  As Crichton fans go - we would rather read more of his techno-babble than the story of Camelot - but  you go into this book prepared - 's worth    As usual, the research is excellent  you do get a good sense of the  past  I especially liked his vision of the multiverse  how  works  The only major flaw was the character of the mad industrialist who wants to  turn the past into an amusement park  Mike - please - find another  villain  Re-vamping the story line from Jurassic Park doesn't work here
Predictable is the word  Character development is totally lacking  I did get into the story midway  found I could not put  down until a rather, here's that word again, predictable, ending  The research is great but  there are holes  I also found myself having to re-read sections because a  significant event was buried under some techincal jumble Someone reviewed  the book as &quot;intellectual&quot;compared to what?  I teach history   found little use despite the research
Rarely have I read a sillier, shallower bookThe writing style is roughly 12th grade, the history-science clumsily interjected, the characters straight out of Batman Comics,  the ending utterly predictable   Crichton must write this stuff  his sleep dreaming all the while of the  many dollars he will make selling this to the movies for which  was  obviously written   is disheartening to be confronted with what is known  as a &quot;best-seller&quot; for  reveals the reading tastes   abilities of the average reader, NO, I didn't finish   Why waste the  time when the ending was apparent from page 20  Bah humbug to you MC   your appallingly badly written books
Crichton's latest movie script, masquerading as a novel, is another tedious formula book  I appreciated his overview of quantum technology, the possibility of multiverses,  his detailed research on medieval Europe  However, any book ( movie) that relies on a clock timer ticking  backwards for suspense is inherently lame   The characters are moderately  interesting, although mostly clich  rarely compelling  Until Crichton  demonstrates an ability to break free from this TVmovie-friendly writing,  I will avoid his future work
No, this is not his best work  But  is worth buying  reading  As Chriton fans go - we would rather read more of his techno-babble than the story of Camelot - but  you go into this book prepared - 's worth    As usual, the research is excellent  you do get a good sense of the  past  I especially liked his vision of the multiverse  how  works  The only major flaw was the character of the mad industrialist who wants to  turn the past into an amusement park  Mike - please - find another  villain  Re-vamping the story line from Jurassic Park doesn't work here
The book has no character development  an obvious plot  He describes the technology  detail, but leaves the cookie-cutter adventure characters up to your imaginiation  's a quick adventure story written for money   the movies  I may actually like the movie better than the book  's  done
The first 100 pages of Timeline raised my expectations, but the rest of the book fails to live up to them Crichton sets up an intriguing premise (parallel universe time travel), some interesting characters,  a well  described setting (the archeological site)  Right after they go back   time, he switches into a &quot;Lost World&quot; writing mode more  appropriate for a screenplay than a book  Any prospect of ongoing  character development goes out the window, the most interesting  implications of multiple universe time travel are ignored  feudal France  is never given the rich description  deserves (those little castle  drawings are nice, but they don't make up for a lack of descriptive prose)   br Characterization, which seemed so promising  the opening chapters,  goes downhill with amazing abruptness  The denizens of medieval France are  scarcely more than cardboard cutouts  What little character they have  seems to be inconsistent from scene to scene  The team of historians, so  interesting  the 20th century, seems to become two-dimensional themselves  after arriving  the past (a side affect of time travel perhaps?  :-)br 's easy to see how the movie adaptation (surely  the works) will  play out  The first 100 pages will be dealt with  about 10 minutes   the rest will be standard Hollywood action fare (one hope for the movie is  that  really will provide us with a more vivid look at 14th century  France, which is lacking  the book)  I wonder  Crichton checked to see   Steven Spielberg, would be available to direct before he even started  writing the book?br As a science fiction fan (as opposed to a Crichton fan)  I was rather disappointed that many of the more interesting aspects of  parallel universe time travel were glossed over  ignored  Why is ITC  mucking about  feudal France when they could be travelling to more  advanced societies  bringing back new technologies (cold fusion  anyone?) For a more  depth look at the particular problems of parallel  universe time travel, I would recommend the short story &quot;All the Myrid  Ways&quot; by Larry Niven  's available  the anthology by the same  name along with Niven's essay &quot;The Theory  Practice of Time  Travel&quot;
Let's see here  took Michael Crichton almost three years to get this book out,  what do we get? A movie During the time I was reading Timeline,  felt almost as  I were reading a screenplay rather than a  novel  While the plot is interesting, certain events that happen are way  too predictable  have that certain &quot;flair&quot; that would make a  good movie  Plus,  also seems like MC's writing style has changed a bit  since Airframe  For some reason he now uses short, precise sentences   characters we don't really give a rip about  Overall, not a bad book, but  for the amount of time  took him to write Timeline, I expected better
Wow, what a huge disappointment  I generally realy like Crichton's work,  when I read that he had written about this subject, I was quite eager to read the book  Aside from the unbelievable  unintelligble scientific  mumbo-jumbo at the beginning, the rest of the book suffered from severe  story  character problems The characters were not believable  for  the most part, very unsympathetic  I never really got the feeleing that  anyone was connected,  there was little dynamic character evolution   The plot device inherent  De Kerr's character seemed like an  afterthought,you never really understand just what the bad guys are trying  to do,  will gain  they prevail  the artificial urgency was a sham   Overall the story was held together by chewing gum  bailing wire, with  lot's of weird transitions  oh-too-convenient last minute solutions from  the heroesbr The overall feeleing I got was that we have a bestselling  author who has lost the plot  stopped trying  His editors should be  ashamed
One might think a novel with a time travel premise called &quot;Timeline&quot; would be about time travel  its far reaching effects on the world  its timeline(s);  is not Instead  is basicly  a story about a few archaeologists who end up caught between feuding  warlords  the middle ages The storyline could have been transplanted to  archaelogists stranded on a present day island  caught between feuding  tribes, clans, etc  isn't really about time travel  about people from  the future who use their modern knowledge  machines to overwhelm their  primitive foes(Eric Flint's &quot;1632&quot; is a good example of that kind  of story); 's just a story about un-armed civilians trying to survive   a warzone The time travel stuff, though beautifully designed  set up,  is largely a gimmick  this story I might have given &quot;Timeline&quot;  4 stars for its great time-travel psuedo-science backdrop, but its  semi-generic midieval adventure story, unrealised conspiracy story   surprisely weak ending only deserved 2 stars
This is the type of book that will keep you up late  the night reading because you have to know what happens next  I highly recommend this book to people who enjoy adventure  fantasy novels as well as people who  don't take things too seriously
I enjoyed Timeline, but I wasn't a hundred pages  when I began to have deja vu  &quot;The Doomsday Book&quot; by Connie Willis, written several years ago,  winner of both the Nebula  Hugo is the superior telling  of virtually the same story  Crichton, as usual writes a book you can't  put down, but I am beginning to wonder where he gets his story ideas from
I  was bitterly disappointed with this attempt at an addition to genre of time travel novels I started reading the book  expecting a well thought out, plausible time travel novel on the order of &quot;Time  Again&quot;  by Jack Finney  After over 100 pages of very detailed information  providing the set up to the time travel itself,  less than a page,  Crichton kills off the only experienced people on the time travel mission   makes  impossible for the other travelers to return to the present   was such a let down to find that he stooped to the fastest  least  plausible way to set up the scene so his &quot;heros&quot; would have to  fend for themselves back  the 14th century  I literally threw the book  across the room   disgust after reading that page   to think I  wasted my money on the  hardback version of this poorly written drivel    you are a diehard M Crichton fan borrow a copy from your library,  otherwise read some of the wonderfully written time travel books that are  there on the shelves
Wow, I haven't had a chance to read this book yet as my father is engrossed with  at the moment, but from all these reviews I can't wait!  As a fan of the tv show Sliders(similar  plot to Timeline from what I've  read so far), I won't be disappointed  Indiana Jones-like adventures? All  the better!  best off,  is a Crichton book!  The creator of Jurassic  Park!  I don't buy many books for leisure as a college student, but this  one caught my eye!  I'm almost certain this will be an enjoyable book just  by the fact my &quot;I don't find science fiction is a good use of  time&quot; father is reading  hogging the book  This is the third time  I bought an item based on reviews,  the first two times the concensus  has not been wrong  Go buy   Now  PS  you must wrestle the Mailman  for the first-grabs, go ahead  do so to avoid the wait!
Crichton's newest title has been a long time coming I have been looking forward to this title ever since I heard  was going to be released I just finished   WOW!  does not disappoint! Crichton's heros are sent  from the present to the past thru a &quot;quantum foam wormhole,&quot;   step out  feudal France circa 1357 The historians have been sent back to  rescue one of their collegues who has become trapped  the past  they  need to rescue him  precisely 37 hours,  miss the trip back to 1999  This novel starts out very technical, but quickly switches to a  &quot;swashbuckling tale&quot; with knights, damsels  distress,  much,  much more! This was a quick read for me; I finished   about a day   12 The ending was predictable, but all  all, a good time!
The technology Crighton describes is far more interesting than the drivel he put forth  this obviously 'for money' work  The storyline leaves no surprises, with the author often leaving this reader more bored than  interested  the storyline He obviously researched some of what he wrote  into the book  gives a basic understanding of some of the concepts such  as Quantum Mechanics  the history of twentieth century physics  However  the characters are all very pale,  he follows a similar plot line to  Sphere where #1 something happens  #2 assemble a team of experts to fix  the problem  BORRRRING! I really fell ripped off at this hack work   will not purchase another of Crightons future works
For a much better-- entirely different--story of travel  a virtual world (which is really what this is about), why not read Tangherlini's leo@fergusrulescom?
What is with the swift endings to Crichton novels? Has anyone else noticed this?   all of the Crichton novels I have read,  never ceases to amaze me how he draws the reader to the edge of their seat for the climax   suddenly 's over Bam Case closed Airframe is a good example of this    was a great mystery-type of thriller (like Disclosure)  then when the  truth is finally explained,  comes  a very dry, boring manner     suddenly one finds oneself on the last page Timeline does the same thing  Once the climax is reached, he dedicated two lazy pages to debriefing   we're done Like Airframe, I was highly disappointed with the ending,    that's why I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5  The weak ending  notwithstanding, the plot  characters are brilliant,  The level of  detail is stunning  I read the book  two days  captivated me   dared me to think outside of the box  compelled me to dream   fantasize   educated me as much as any history book I have read  my  life Other than the ending, this is a phenomenally creative work of art   I applaude MC for the terrific research  time that went into this  book  I still recommend  highly for someone who loves geeky, technical  stuff, a penchant for history, has the patience to comprehend the depth of  the writing  many parts
I liked this book But I like all of Mr Crichton's books Same type plot
This is not a great book The science  the history are speculative; the characters are wooden  undeveloped;  too often the story depends on fortunate circumstance to keep  alive The amount of blood  gore tells  us Chricton has spent too much time  the ERbr Timeline reads as    were writen by a committee Clearly Crichton has a lot on his plate;  perhaps too much  this is the result
Timeline was not terribly engaging   would make a better comic book than  did a novel  There were so many cliffhangers  near disasters that suspension of belief began to wear thin  The action was swift   furious, without question, but I expected a different level of depth   character  plot development for a 400 page novel  Not Crichton's best,  but I'm sure 'll make a blockbuster movie some day
I found this book to be well below the standards I expect from this author  He does much better with biology than mathmatics for the science  scienc fiction  Also to expect the reader to believe that modern men  with little  no training could defeat midevil warriors who have been  training their whole life is just too unbelievable  A premise like time  travel deserves much better
Having read most of Crichton's books, I'm under no illusion that he's a great writerhe's not even close to that What he does better than most is to 'push the envelope'  explore issues that are usually at the exotic  fringe of society, but not mainstream Thus I was not disappointed with  TimelineI found  quite engaging There were some serious lapses   logic, but most of Crichton's books are like that For light, quick reading  this book is a winner The movie that follows will surely rake  millions  He knows what he's doing
I bought this book because I am a fan of both MC  time travel fantasy books  But I found that the book read like a cross between a script for a Sunday night CBS movie  an AD&amp;D adventure; the characters are  shallow  the story predictable  There were far too many coincidences   just--time-to-save-the-day's  I'm not a geneticist, but I found  Jurassic believable; perhaps the absurdity of the physics kept getting   the way of this story  On the other hand, maybe MC is hoping to flip this  over to Hallmark as-is to make a TV movie,  he's spent too much time with  ER
I have read every Michael Crichton book he as written, be  fact  fiction This is hands down the best book I have ever read by him,  I will recommend  to all my friends
I liked the book quite a bit  I have visited England  been  Medieval Castles  this book was right up my alley  I will now definately plan a trip to France to get a continued dose of this time period  I enoy all of   Crichtons' books the &quot;science&quot; does get a bit intense to  follow for those of us who are not so scientific  I recommend this book   I'll read  again  a year
Michael Crichton's latest book, Timeline, is a fast paced thriller While  is extremely difficult to top novels like Sphere  Rising Sun, Crichton's latest is certainly up to par  was most certainly worth the  three year wait
I have read all of Crichton's books, , with the exception of &quot;Lost World,&quot; enjoyed them allparticularly &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; But this book was just featureless, both from the standpoint of  character development  plot  the end I had to ask myself what  was  about the book that was -  any way - redeeming  I must admit that I  did find the physics somewhat interesting Nonetheless, HGWells'  &quot;Time Machine&quot; this was not A very disapointing effort from an  otherwise highly entertaining author whose other books all sit on my  shelves
Let's face  -- Mr Crichton is no slouch A thorough researcher, prolific writer  skilled storyteller, he is an admired icon  great  contributor to our popular culture Which is why we all look forward to  reading new releases of his work,  which is why I just paid the full  price for the hardcover copy of Timeline at a local bookstore here   Vermontbr The introduction is compelling,  exciting What promise! The  story was captivating until yes, unfortunately there is an  &quot;until&quot; here the main characters arrive back  time  Suddenly, all of the cleverness of the premise,  the promise of a great  story, plummets into a bad plot from a Renaissance Festival I mean, a  joust? Frolicing peasants? Snarling bad guys  black armor? That's ?   the dialog: &quot;So, the pig approaches&quot;? I thought Mr Crichton was  trying to make the point that the modern stereotypes of the &quot;Dark  Ages&quot; were inaccurate You'd never guess  from this treatmentbr All  that aside, I still couldn't put the book down,  I finished  within  two days But boy, I was really hoping for something more br Save your  money  you want to read a really good book on the period, which has  interesting ( real) historic characters  a fabulous  terrifying  narrative, then do yourself a favor  buy Barbara Tuchman's &quot;A  Distant Mirror&quot; insteadbr That's a book you won't regret adding to  your library,  you won't see  on video within 18 months either
I have really enjoyed all his other books, without exception, until this oneevery author is entitled to write an occasional dud,  I'm afraid Crichton has done  here  Cardboard boring characters, obvious plot,  silly scienceingredients similar to past books but for some reason the  cake doesn't rise for this one
I think that Michael Crichton has come up with a book that captures the imagination  I enjoyed the premise of jumping through time even   is far fetched  After reading the negative reviews I was skeptical about how  good the book would be  But, I was glad I bought 
 you have read  enjoyed any book by Michael Crichton,  is well worth your time to read Timeline  The book is Chrichton's traditional mix of high-tech science  old-fashioned adventure   short, Timeline is to  time travel what Jurassic Park was to genetic engineering  While the  similarities between the two might be enough to call them overly formulaic,   is definitely a good formula  This story will clearly become a movie   the near future (when reading , try Sean Connery as Johnston  Antonio  Banderas as Marek),  sell millions of copies, but don't allow Crichton's  commercial success to spoil your enjoyment of the product  Timeline flows  smoothly from cutting edge physics to obscure but interesting history to  heart-stopping suspense, all Crichton trademarks  Few authors are able to  make the reader simultaneously think  be entertained, yet with Timeline  Chrichton does just this  This book is his best since Jurassic Park,  perhaps because of a shared literary algorithm,   may sound simple,  but  you liked Jurassic Park, Timeline is worth your while
Simply put, this is one of the best Crichton novels ever written  has good amounts of science, lots of action, a good storyline,  chilling villans You just gotta love ! Being something of a physicist myself, I  was happy with the level of explanation on the topic of quantum foam Buy  this book!
Absolutely no character development whatsoever Mr Crichton didn't seem to be writing for himself,  the reader as much as for the movies You could practically see each camera setup  his head Maybe he should time  travel back to his early writing days, so he could remember what  was  like
This is not one of the author's best, but  still held my interest  Character development is very weak  at times the story becomes pretty uninvolving
I brought this book because I am a fan of Michael Crichton I brought  after I read the Introduction  the first few pages At first I think that Michael can give me a picture of the future technology  an exciting  adventure of time travel, but I cannot find what I expected  this book   Secondly, the layout of the story is not very good that you can tell the  ending of the story after you finish reading half of  The last  disappointment is the character, who is the major character  This book  do not have a clear picture about who is the major character  This book  spends a lot of effort to descript the world  14th Century   does a  good job  creating attactive pictures of 14th Century However, I am  looking at a scientific story from Michael, not just a story about Knight   WarLord
This was a great book! I though, from reading the jacket that i Might not enjoy , quantom foam seemed so hard to explain But then using  experiment with beams of light an slits, i found  wasn't that different  As  Jurassic Park, this idea for traveling  'time'  to a different  'multiverse' seems perfectly plausible, as did the resercetion of the  dinosaurs  Jurassic Parkbr Last night, i read untill 1  the morning,  reading the last 300 pages of the bookbr  was greast
 you want to read some really wonderful books about time travel, scroll up to search  type  Connie Willis  The &quot;Domesday Book&quot;is a magical treatment of time travel  &quot;To Say Nothing of the Dog&quot;  is a delightful VictorianWWII adventure  As for Timeline, wait for the  paperback
Alright, so  was enjoyable, a very easy read,  no doubt coming to a theater near you  Michael Crichton doesn't even bother to write novels anymore - this was a screenplay, through   throughbr &quot;Timeline&quot; features lots of crash-bang action,  one-dimensional characters, goofy heroes that start weak  end up saving  the day, improbable resolutions to impossible situations, amazing  coincidences,  laughable romancebr But  you go into this book  expecting these elements  little else, you won't be disappointed,   may actually enjoy , as I did  See  you can pick out the number of  times the heroes get something like 5,000 arrows shot at them  only get  nicked,  the number of times the heroes are on one side of a vicious  swordfight with 20 enemies  yet they win  I lost countbr Great  literature?  No  A non-stop, adventurous piece of entertaining escapism?  Yup
I really enjoy Mr Crichton's book's for his velocity (He won't waste your time getting started  for the first 100  so pages), for his challenge to my comprehension of scientific possibilities,  more-often-than-not his  twisting plotsbr I also rate as one of my favorite books, Mark Twain's  &quot;Conneticut Yankee  King Arthur's Court&quot;  So to find both the  pluses of Chichton  the premise of &quot;Conneticut Yankee&quot;  the  same book was exciting to mebr  is a fast-paced bood that will keep you  reading --  excellent book for that 2-4 hour flight for the holidays   But don't expect too much  charater depth, nor the  total plausibility  of the scientific basis  I also agree with other readers that some of the  scenes, particularly the time transfer  the initial views of the valley,  seemed to be almost precise definitions for camera setups for a screen  play  br But since Crichton is probably on retainer for all future works  since the dinosaur movies of his, why should that surprise the reader?br So  relax  enjoy!   I recommend  to you  's a fun book to read,  thoroughly engaging,   will keep the person next to you from talking  your ear off while you're traveling; thus worth 's weight  gold!
I anxiously awaited this new book as my son  I have read all of Crichton  My hopes of furthering science frontiers were dashed as the theories were not carried through  I prayed the constant life-threatening  situations would end with the death of all the undeveloped characters   Crichton's research of the era is obvious, but the story line is lacking
I'm a big fan of Crichton's works  I think he has an incredible knack for keeping you involved, but this book just didn't live up  I really anticipated reading this, considering that I love time travel stories, even   they are couched  a cowboys  Indians theme like the Terminator  movies  But, to echo the sentiment of other reviewers, this book is a  movie   has an incredibly weak plot,  I didn't even have to read  thoroughly to know what was going to happen next  What I liked about  Jurassic Park is that I wasn't sure who was going to live  who was going  to die  Another annoying thing was that the character development  this  book was really bad  There was no main character  I think a good author  would've made Marek the main character  All  all, I'd recommend reading    you are a Crichton fan, but don't expect too much
The book starts very slowly with the usual Chrichton story line - greedy corporation upsets the natural order through creative  imaginative scientific breakthroughs designed for obscene profits The story meanders  for more than 100 pages before the jousting  swordfights begin I really  enjoyed the action  medieval France, but the science fiction part was  unimpressive
This book was so intense!  I couldn't put  down  Just thinking about the concepts  this book make me wonder  anyone is actually trying to do   I hope they make a movie because  would be amazing!  All of the  action  tense moments not to be shown up by the pure emotion of the  characters!  I think  is his best work yet!
Once I finally reached the end of this painful experience I was distraught that I was stuck on a subway  there were no garbage cans to donate this worthless piece of high school action to I honestly feel less intelligent  after the experience  refuse to think that just because Crichton has  written good books before that  somehow is a natural talent The  characters were unbelievable The scenarios seemed to be from a Monty  Python flick The thrills  suspense are ridiculous Please let someone  else warn you before you waste your money Use  to donate to abandoned  animals insteadbr I honestly do not understand how professional reviewers  are rating this so high  You'll notice that they are usually only quoting  from the first 20 pages of this book, which shows how much they care about  reading this nonsense
As a time travel buff I was really looking forward to reading this one I've enjoyed many of Crichton's books  was hoping he'd deliver a classic time travel novel Unfortunately the time travel element was implausible at  best, especially the bit about not being able to mess up the timeline   you like action, swordplay,  skin of their teeth escapes, read this  book  you like time travel, read  anyway but don't expect too much
Timeline is a decent, fast read, but wasn't at all what I was expecting after seeing Matt Lauer interview the author on Good Morning America  I love an historical novel, but this doesn't qualify   had a healthy dose  of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;  somewhere  the middle I got the distinct  impression that Crichton wasn't writing a novel at all, but was more  interested  a screen playbr  you like Indiana Jones type action, buy   now   you think you're getting a thinking man's novel, wait for the  paperback
I was right-spun  than left-spun, which left me kind of dizzy Our universe, other universes, where exactly was the time traveling happening Send people into the past, but restrict their inventiveness so that no  person can develop  use advance technology;  yet claim that the  actions of an individual can not alter the future I felt Crichton has a  wonderful time travel concept, better than he did  'Sphere', but he  restricts  giving  the flavor of &quot;Westworld&quot; rather than  &quot;A Connecticut Yankee  King Arthur's Court&quot; The plot was  crisis driven, that was okay, but I would have loved to have had   sprinkled with some humor I have to be honest, even though I gave this  book 3 stars-mainly because Crichton used a Feynman type character  the  background, 's a must read
While the plot did not seem to develop correctly, the book was extremely gripping  entertaining overall Not nearly as much fun as Jurassic Park  Sphere, but a good novel to pick up when  hits paperback (don't spend  the 25 bucks) The history shows good research on Crichton's part
 my experience, Crichton has had two types of novels: those with groups facing danger (Sphere, Congo, JP I &amp; II),  those where the main character must solve a complex problem everyone around him understands  better than heshe does (Rising Sun, Disclosure, Airframe) Well, now you  can add a third category: books written for Hollywood screen play JP II  was  that vein, so too Timeline 's as  he envisions camera angles  before scenarios Timeline had all the usual Crichton hallmarks: incredible  depth of research, full-on pacing,  light characterization His strength  is funneling reams of scientific postulation down into a view of the future  that may very well be I often take his theories as fact, so impressive is  his knowledge But  the end, Timeline could not live up to others like  Jurassic Park, Disclosure  Rising Sun Perhaps  was the wild alternate  time theories boiled down the lowest common denominator,  the same  character formula seen  his other novels
A great cast of characters  an intriguing idea about time travel, but the looming problem with the book is the formula  follows The plot twists are predictable at times  even downright tiresome However, that  doesn't stop you from turning the pages  plunging into another one of  Crichton's worlds
I was comforted to know that others felt the same -- that this book read more like a long movie script than a book  This book has way to many near death  saved at the last minute scenes to be believable  I was pleading  to the author about halfway through to put them out of their misery!br I  like the overall story line but  the hands of a more talented author this  book could have really become something For instance, character  interactions more developed, scenery described for a reader, not someone  who would be watching TV, etc  This book, as  reads, is a movie script  -- nothing more
When I reread this classic by Voltaire I found that i had discovered the meaning of life When he says at the end that he has to go  work  the garden I was reminded of Peter Sellers  Being There The true value   life,  the way to find happiness is through work,  not just any work  but work that produces the basic necessities of life
OK, so the setup for the trip to the past wasn't totally plausable,  maybe the physics detail was much more than I wanted to know,  yes they did seem to have an amazing amount of 'nick-of-time' luck--but once I  started reading, I couldn't stop  's an entertaining story, with heroes   villains  castles  swordplay--so what  's not great  literature,  was fun!  I kept turning those pages because I just had to  see what happened next  As so many others have said, this should make one  heck of a movie  Are you listening, Steven?
This is one of Michael Crichton's best works  not the best The book was over 400 pgs long  i finished   two days, i just couldn't put  down When  was  over i wanted more He is an awesome storyteller,   i highly recommend   you like action-adventure books!
I loved Airframe by the same author  was intrigued by the idea of time-travel as a theme  this one  What I WASN'T prepared for,  excited about was the entire book turning into a medieval adventure  Just not the  kind of story that flips my switch  's like I walked into a steakhouse   was served pizza instead  About three quarters of the way into the  book,  got sooo slow I finally just skipped ahead to see how  ended:   Predictably
Looks like another 'old rich guy goes bezerk  builds ultra futuristic technology' Well  is That's not to say this is a bad book Timeline updates the general public the current theories of the physical world,   perhaps what to expect  the near future The adventure to 14th century  France by a team of 20th century historians makes an anachronistic  appearance Combats range from scientific to blade to blade fighting How  do you send a message to the past without going there? The technology is  terrifying   of itself Quantum computers  machines destroy your  body, record your data, faxes you through a wormhole  lets another  universe reconstitute you Who can say you're dead when you've just been  reconstructed at the same time? Horrific Brilliant Another Crichton  masterpiece
Timeline is a sad example of a successful  talented author taking a tired formula with a semi-interesting scientific twist (quantum magic) creating a movie--waiting only thinly disguised as a novel We have come  to expect so much more from Crichton  he delivers so little here  Character development is minimal  the villains are cartoonish  their  stereotypicality Crichton's batting average has been high going all the  way back to early work like The Great Train Robbery But he took a weak  swing here  struck out This milennium version of The Time Machine meets  Bill Gates really bytes
This book is so typical of Chricton's work --  excels  some places, but is really a let down  others As always, 's obvious that the author did a great deal of research before writing this book, both into quantum  mechanics  medieval France However, this time I did't feel as  I  really got to know anything about the new technology Jurassic Park taught  me about cloning, Andromeda Strain taught me about Virii, Sphere taught me  about water pressure, etcI still feel I have no idea what 'quantum foam'  is This is due mostly to the Chricton contradicting himself quite He says  that the characters aren't actually going back  time, but that they are  going to one of infinite other universes which is exactly like ancient  france was, yet somehow when things are dropped there, they end up   archeological digs  our universe He tries to justify this with some  analogy about lights shining through slits, but  doesn't sit right Also,  you know who's going to make  back almost from page one   the  obligatory preface,  says that  ends up with one person missing  two  injured,  there are a total of four who go back's not real  difficult to figure out The characters are very flat, given one  two  personality traits apiece as well as maybe a line of physical description  Only one character actually evolves at all through the book,  the  ancient 'bad guy' doesn't remain a mystery real long Despite all this  bashing, though, I must say that I really enjoyed this book  was well  written, a definite page turner The action was well written, the suspense  was pretty good most of the time,  you could tell the author had a  pretty good idea what ancient castles  monastaries looked like I'd  recommend picking this one up  you're looking for some good, entertaining  reading, but not  you're looking for strong, original literature
I had heard about Michael Crichton  the past but never ventured out from Koontz  King I loved the writing style  character build-up  Timeline The clock ticking down throught out the book kept you spellbound   the ending was great Crichton has a new fan as of now
Jurrasic Park had the excitement of pushing the envelope of science  technology  a direction of credibility   may be years before something like that would be possible, but, certainly, someday  would be possible   None of that here  Parallel universes?    particular, dismissing the  effect of an action  the past as having no relevance to the course of  subsequent history?   There is no science here, just a contrived bunch of  nonsense reminiscent of The Celestine Prophecy   is juvenile, pure  science fiction without basis  any science at all   is for children,  except for all the violence  A real disappointment from an aouthor who was  able to capture the imagination so effectively  Jurrasic Park

Perhaps 's because I'm a history buff, perhaps not  This was a page turner!  Only put  down when I couldn't keep my eyes open from lack of sleep Loved the characterizations Loved the book!
When I was  the bookstore, I recommended TIMELINE to a young woman who was shopping for a gift for her grandmother  I just finished the book  I told her &quot;Give this book to your Grandma&quot; She was looking at  staid, grandmotherly (what people think of as grandmotherly, that is)  titles I told her grandmothers love adventure  thrilling stories as  much as anyone else   I bet you do, too
I decided to buy this book after I saw Charlie Rose interview Crichton about this new novel of his  I have read the book through,  rank  high among the books I have read   was well thought out  researched,   the imaginative plot flows well  quickly [despite some protests I  have read]  included facts of the time [medieval] which make  all the  more believable   response to a certain comment - that the average  reader feels about six college degrees of separation - I must admit a  complete understanding of the novel  High school physics covers most of  the quantum theory he uses, minus the quantum foam  As a sophomore  high  school, I certainly hope that the general population of readers understands  the backdrop of physics  history  A good novel, living up to Crichton's  standards,  I recommend  to all readers
This book is exciting  its action, above par  its historical content, but more like reading a movie script than reading a good novel   is a good read that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end   However,  seemed to me after finishing the book that there was more  intrigue  the introduction to the book than there was  the novel  itselfbr  you like a good action packed book with some historical  content  some technological content with a futuristic bent, read this  book  I personally enjoyed the Andromeda Strain, Airframe  The Great  Train Robbery better   you read the introduction  want a book that is  as intriguing, you will be disappointed  Most of all, go to the movie--  should be a good one  (Hopefully the ending of the book will fit better   the movie than  did  the book)
This was an exciting, fast-paced read  Like some of the other reviewers, I could not put  down  read   a day  a half When I was little, I was fascinated by the stories of King Arthur  movies like  &quot;Excalibur&quot;  I had dreams about going back  time to the Middle  Ages  Crichton's book makes the dream so vivid,  describes  detail  just how dangerous  would be He has obviously done a great deal of  research,  does a great job of explaining quantum physics, which is the  wave of the future   you are interested  this kind of subject, you  should not be disappointed
Like many of the other readers who have ventured to write a review of this book, I found  to be a fascinating read, one  which I literally could not put down the book until I realized  was well past my usual bed time  The subject of time travel, backed-up with just enough ( not too much)  scientific reasoning to support the belief  its eventual  imagined  possibility, is a thrilling concept  Add to this, the chance to visit an  era  which knights roamed western Europe  people lived   around  castles, all described vividly by Crichton as  he had been there,  himselfbr That said, once the cast of main characters arrives  the High  Middle Ages of France, their interactions with the medieval citizens   the non-stop action provides for quick page-turning; however, this is also  the point where  begins to get a bit too much to swallow (having  swallowed so much already to get to this point)  This cast of characters  is like a team of superheroes, each one with individual talents, strengths   fatal flaws  One is an expert rock climber, another is nearly fluent   several medieval languages, dialects  weaponry usage,  the last  one is a scholar of medieval technologies  As can be easily predicted  during the introductions  characterizations of this cast, all of these  strengths will certainly come into play later on  the book,  they do  Again  again  again  Sometimes, you wonder when one of them will  suddenly sprout wings  say, &quot;Hang on, I learned this cool flying  trick while I was an aviation major back at Yalebefore I switched to  history&quot;br Still, despite the tremendous leaps  superhuman skill   a never-ending supply of luck that Crichton liberally grants his  characters, I truly enjoyed the fantasy that oozes from the book  found  the imaginative departure from our modern world to be refreshing  I would  definitely recommend this book to friends
's become common to criticize Crichton's characterization as flat  his writing style as turgid; Ian Malcolm's interminably pedantic lectures  &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; come to mind as an example of the  latterbr Curiously, &quot;Timeline&quot; suffers from that problem less  than many of its predecessors; yet, 's a less successful workbr The  single biggest problem with &quot;Timeline&quot; is that Crichton, though  having obviously spent his time researching quantum mechanics  medieval  history, neglected to put equal thought into his storybr **SPOILERS  BELOW**br Other reviewers have noted that the entire fulcrum of the plot --  the discovery of a message  1357 by a present day professor -- is simply  incompatible with the scientific explanation Crichton gives  As he notes,  time travel is not possible; the &quot;machine&quot; opens a gateway to a  parallel universe  So how does the professor leave a message  THIS  world?br That is the biggest flaw, but not the only one  Other errors  abound, such as the duel that Hughes inadvertently accepts; Marek then  challenges the person who offered the duel; that person insists that Marek  fight his protector first,   Marek survives, he can continue; Marek  accepts  All of a sudden, Marek is fighting the protector,  Hughes is  fighting his original antagonist  What gives?br That being said, I read  &quot;Timeline&quot;  a little over a day over Thanksgiving break  's  definitely readable; 's just too bad that Crichton fails to follow his  own pseudo-science
My best guess is that Crichton knocked this movie treatment out over a weekend to meet a contract deadline The science, especially the incredibly disappointing treatment of time paradoxes, is superficial - not just a lack  of techincal depth but also none of the compelling conceptual exploration  of Andromeda Strain, Jurassic Park,  even Rising Sun Quantum computing,  quantum foam  the multiverse interpretation of quantum mechanics become  mere deus ex machina weaving together scenes of pointless gore br   technology gets abused, The Green Knight  the Black Death get better  treatment from Monty Pythonbr I could go on, but I expect the reader gets  my drift This is not a book but rather an off the cuff movie idea
I purchased Timeline on the first day of publication   took the better part of two weeks to get through this boring book  Although I like most of Crichton's books this one missed the mark by a mile  Although an  interesting premise the science is too remote  unbelievable   I  wanted to read history I would have gone to the library  The book was  predictable  frequently repetitive Save your money  your time
Great reading!  Started off a little slow but once things start rolling I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen  Michael Crichton puts so much research into his work  you can really tell   this book
To put  simply,  an attempt to avoid useless rambling; like many of Crichton's other books, 'Timeline' is an amazing story idea but, since Crichton is an overall bad* author, the book fails to remain interesting**  beyond the summarybr * because of his terrible paragraph structure,  unbalanced  ineffective combination of history lessons  the story,  repetitive use of adjectives, laughable attempt at drama,  angering use  of those damnable 2-dot section breaks ESPECIALLY when no break is  neccessarybr ** even with all those repetitive  unimaginative plot  twists
OK, so, anyone who just glances at the bibliography for this science fiction book should be very impressed  I was  But, after finishing , I was also a bit disappointed at the story overall  Maybe I'm being cynical,  but Crichton is a wonderfully inventive,  interesting writer whose  subjects are unusual  the sci-fi world  He writes about real science,   a scientific fictional way  That's cool  What's not, is when the story  isn't up to the level of research he's put into the book, nor the time I've  invested  reading br As the Emperor says, &quot;So Be &quot;  's  an OK read, not something to go out  buy immediately  Wait for the  paperback (cheaper) version
One word: YUCK!  I was really looking forward to reading this book, but was sadly disappointed   was ok up until we're taken back into the Middle Ages where I found  very ho hum I thought  would be a lot more  interesting  the author expanded on the parallel universe theory   borrowed a little Stephen King a la The Talisman where characters can step  into  out of these universes just  the nick of time  I basically  skipped the last half  read the final couple pages - what a  disappointment!
One of my favorite authors has let me down  Timeline has the characteristics of a made-for-tv movie  the book seems shallow  poorly thought out  I've read a lot of science fiction,  this book's storyline  has been done better by others  I look to Crichton for an innovative   gripping story This isn't 
&quot;Timeline&quot;: is quite boring, literarily a disaster,  even the science behind  looks questionable  unconvincing 's not a novel, but rather what I would call a long description of a movie I could hardly  believe that  was written by the same great author who has given us  &quot;Congo&quot;,  &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; My impression is that  Crichton himself is well aware of how weak the idea behind the novel is  Then, hundreds  hundreds of repetitive pages about the Middle Ages  aren't but about endless chases,  cartoonish coups de theatre The long   useless list of sources at the end of the volume cannot make up for the  author's (regrettable) superficial treatment of both history,   time-travel implications of quantum physics What a pity!
This is one time where the movie will likely be better than the booka real Indiana Jones type story
I thought this book was good  I don't have the foggiest idea what quantum physics is,  don't really care However, Mr Crichton made the physics aspect of the book easy to understand  I really enjoyed the thought of  being able to return to a time that you are interested  I think the book  is well-written  easy to follow  you want a good read, with some  &quot;fantasy&quot;  history involved, this is 
Maybe 's because Michael Crichton has such an absorbing writing style, because I cannot help but feel a little disappointed when I finish his books  This book has great storytelling, althought the premise is quite a  bit short of being feasible    writing an action novel, there seems  to be just a little bit too much of the  &quot;whatever-can-go-wrong-will-go-wrong&quot; writing style  Someone  else described this book as &quot;escapist&quot;  That is probably  accurate, since there is only the one main plot line,  the characters  are not really developed much  Having said all this, I couldn't put the  book down,  am anxiously awaiting the movie version!
I was very excited when I heard that Michael Crichton had written a new book  After all, I've always enjoyed his books tremendously (especially after he tore the press a new one during a talk to the National Press Corps  a few years ago  Washington--I have been a BIG Crichton fan since then)  After the first few chapters I was hoping the story would develop into  another one of the wonderful Crichton techno-thrillers but the book  deteriorated into a medieval adventure story after about fifty pages    you are into adventure stories, by all means buy this book But this  adventure story could never live up to Clive Cussler
I found this to be an excellent book  The pace moves right along   is hard to put down  The premise might be stretching  a bit, but hey, could happen!  I love the way Crichton writes; easy to read, to  the point  he makes the technical stuff accessible to all readers  Its  hard to rate this against his other books because they all are equally  great  You won't be disappointed to buy this book
The application of the Quantum Physics theories was fascinating with its contrasts of &quot;then&quot;  &quot;now&quot;The time of knighthood sounded about as raw  as  probably was! The characters were larger than  life but also believably vulnerable  imperfect(I wondered who his  models were?)I couldn't stop reading  when I finished I felt like I had  been through a Raiders of the Lost Ark experience!
Pretty good book,finished all 450 pages  2 days That shows how much excitement there was  that book
Am I the only one who sees the more than striking similarity betweenTimeline  The Doomsday Book by Connis Willis?  The church, the egocentric bad guy, the internal translater, oh no are we going to get back to the correct time period, etc, etc, etc  Where Crichton cannot seem to make the characters believable  three dimensional, Willis doesread the far superior Doomsday Book
Found the time travel plot a bit hokey Plus, Chrichton excels at the intricacies of science  this book's deep-fried time travel explanations seem poorly thought out We may have found the first bit of evidence that  Mr Chrichton has spent too much time watching movies made from his books  To many movies with easy outs that fit the momentum of the story To find  suggestions for better reading, visit Recommendocom
You'd think a book about time travel, written by the author of &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; would be great escapist fiction Instead, Michael Crichton's &quot;Timeline&quot; is a book to escape  [[[[ital]]]]from[[[[[end ital]]]]]  To his credit, Crichton takes the  &quot;what &quot; genre very seriously He does a lot of research,   his creations are often rooted  cutting-edge science   &quot;Timeline,&quot; a shadowy high-tech corporation called ITC learns how  to reconfigure a human being  slip him into another universe This  technology involves quantum physics  parallel computing  Crichton  understands this stuff, but the average reader may feel about six college  degrees of separation from  ITC is also funding the restoration of a  medieval French ruin Professor Johnston, head of the restoration team,  discovers what ITC is doing  demands to be sent to 14th-century France  Johnston lands  trouble  before you can say &quot;pass the Grey  Poupon,&quot; three of his colleagues are beamed to medieval France to save  him  &quot;Timeline&quot; is filled with silly dialogue  thinly etched  characters The only interesting one is medieval historian Andre Marek, a  slab of Mensa beefcake with a jones for jousting  His ultimate fate is  easy to guess The brutish action takes place during a war that actually  happened, but repetition  predictability ultimately drain the thrills   Marek  Co run around castles  mix  up with knights They get  separated  reunited They get thrown into dank cells  then escape  Meanwhile, the cast of British  French medieval characters spend most of  the book scheming  yelling Worse, Crichton assigns the main villain -  ITC chief Doniger - a punishment that makes the heroes look bad   &quot;Timeline&quot; is about satisfying as watching armor rust
Michael Chrichton has written an excellent novel, well thought out  gripping However, I found some of the passages to be slow  heavy  addition, I found the switching bewteen time periods a bit strained   contrived One author who has mastered this technique is Ann Benson, author  of the Plague Tales  the Burning Road  you liked Timeline, I would  highly recommend both of these books; Benson does an excellent job of  tackling two tales  one book Timeline is an interesting  intriguing  book, but would benefit from a more flowing style  better editing
 seems many writers struggle earlym reach a plain of success  then go into decline Apparently this has happened to Michael Crichton  The book is entertaining, but the plot rambles without control I do not regret buyg  the book, but I was generally disappointed I  would give this book 1 &amp;  12 stars  was an option
This book had an interesting concept,  was nicely executed However,  you like the dual time line, there's another book you should read 's by a relatively unknown author, Ann Benson, but  was very good, much better  than &quot;Timeline&quot; The name of the book is &quot;The Plague  Tales&quot; I have to say that  &quot;TimeLine&quot; the  characterization was a little weak  &quot;Plague Tales&quot; 's much  better, more -depth I love Adele! I just thought  was so much better  than &quot;Timeline&quot; so  you bothered to read &quot;Timeline&quot;  you should definitely read &quot;The Plague Tales&quot;
I like fiction - but this was pure nonsense
Crichton is such a master of blending science, history,  fantasy into such a rich tapestry, that 's hard to distinguish what is real  what is fancy I found some of the science hard to follow, especially since the  scientists  the book refer to the tramsmission to another universe as  akin to sending a fax  I thought that was a bad analogy given that when a  fax is sent, the original document remains at the point of origin,  is  not sent over the wires  But don't let a bad analogy keep you from this  book  The book brings fourteenth century Europe to life so exquisitely,  that you, indeed, are transplanted to Medieval France Critchon describes  the people living, working, fighting , dying with great detail   color  From the cold sore on the sleeping soldier's lip to the lice  crawling about the mad knight's beard to the stench of the market square,  Crichton descriptions are telling without making one's eyes glaze over   The story itself is novel  the ending very powerful  sweet  's  amazing how a good author can stir one's mind into seeing  feeling all  that the characters see  feel  I probably will never get to visit  modern day France, but after reading this book, I feel as  I have lived   fourteenth century France  witnessed all its beauty, brutality,   wonder
This book was terrificly done  Crichton blends facts  with fiction magnificently,  keeps the reader guessing on what will come next  His multi-story format, with the group of people  the present  the group   the past, keeps the book fresh  br This is a fantastic adventure,  better than any work of his I have read  the past   you like the  author, you will not go wrong with this book
I couldn't put this book down 's a great read
This is a masterful book full of suspense  action Crichton's wonderful skill of integrating side by side the past  the present is astounding I finished the book  2 days  never once, did the material become  superfluous, trite,  boring I would definitely recommend this book for  anyone who loves Michael Crichton (MC)  any reader who hasn't read any of  MC's books This takes the place of his best book, Jurrassic Park easily  Even though I have  read all of MC's books, I have never read anything  as good as Timeline Read this book, 's worth the effort  time!
I guess Crichton is now into screenplays, instead of novels Although the reserach  technical part of the book is very good, the development of the story  the past is just another Lost World episode, where people are  chased all over the place His earlier novels (inlcuding Jurassic Park) had  a great combination of action  science This book is great  very good   the science  theory, but the adventure, is just another dumb  screenplay of wild geese being chased
I believe  is an unwritten rule that every science fiction writer must take a stab at a time travel story line at some point  hisher writing career All time travel story lines suffer from similar major logistical  flaws, but I still find them entertaining I had hoped that MC would have  constructed a storyline that was more plausible than most, but he didn't   is my opinion that MC's greatest strength is that his books are much  more realistic than those of other science fictionfact writers, but  is  my perception that Timeline is much further divorced from reality than any  of MC's other books I never bought into the whole &quot;sense of  urgency&quot; the characters were operating under (time travel would of  course have permitted many opportunites to achieve the same goal)
Michael Crichton delivers again He makes accessible something not usually so (quantum physics),  entertains  even teaches the reader things he didn't know (I learned a lot about Japan from RED SUN, while being riveted  with suspense at the same time) TIMELINE is the best thriller I've read  since AIRFRAME  Craig Furnas' THE SHAPE,  I would like to see  TIMELINE as a movie, so I hope a studio doesn't jerk Crichton around on  TIMELINE the way Disney did with AIRFRAME (who bought the rights for $10  million, but that Crichton bought back from them for $9 million when he saw  no movie would result He took a $1 million loss on AIRFRAME! ) That's  dedication to your work,  dedication comes across  TIMELINE I wish he  were as prolific as Grisham But,  he were, his books would probably be  as bad as Grisham's
After the fantastic success of Jurassic Park, why should Crichton mess around? Substitute quantum mechanics for DNA,  instead of bringing the past into the present, bring the present into the past!br What you've got  here is a very entertaining screenplay for a blockbuster action flick Very  enjoyable, very forgettable  very familiar Don't look for much  the  way of character development, although I did enjoy this cast more than the  whining kids  Jurassic Park br Let the ancillary rights bidding begin!
As the latest  a series of increasingly obvious mass-market Crichton thrillers, Timeline shows the clearest example yet of Crichton's formula for maximum sales  Take a well-worn idea ( this case, time-travel);  populate the story with characters that have &quot;typecasting&quot;  written all over them (Antonio Banderas as Marek, Oliver Platt as the  English lord, Chris O'Donnell as Chris Hughes);  string together a half  a dozen Big Scenes (the mill blows up; the French attack; the monastery  burns down) with all the plot rationale of a video game  The concept  would've made a far better book had Crichton been able to think outside the  &quot;gotta make a movie&quot; box What's more, the &quot;science&quot; of  this science fiction is nonsensical even by its own logic For instance,  [abbreviating whole chapters of posturing about quantum mechanics], the  cast travels to a _parallel universe_ which only appears to be our 14th  century;  yet, one of them buries a document ( that other universe)  that somehow turns up at an archeological dig  our universe  Huh?  Fans  of Robert Heinlein's madcap time-travel stories ( Orson Card's  underappreciated &quot;Timewatch&quot;) will find this kind of thing  disappointing;  Crichton is going to make up rules, he should at least  have the discipline to follow them As a kid, I was a big science fiction  fan;  the first book of &quot;grown-up&quot; science fiction I read was  The Andromeda Strain   was creepy,  subtle,  a literal page  turner  What happened since then?
I truly love Michael Chrichton, his blend of Science Fiction, Science Fact,  Thriller elements, is a trademark of his that I've particularly enjoyed  This book is no exception, with some truly harrowing moments,   entertaining dialogue, timeline plays like a big budget Will Smith movie,  unfortunately, that's all  is  Crichton wrote Timeline not for the  reading crowd, but for the moviegoing crowd  The book makes use of several  movie cliches 'Rot  Hell!'-'You First'  others  The character  development is all done through dialogue, the bad guy gets what's coming to  him, the good guy gets the girl etc  Timeline even goes so far as to  include illustations  the text   really is a pity, because when  Chrichton writes for direct book-to-screenplay conversion, his novels lose  something
This book is as fictional as  gets  's time for people to live  the real world  stop thinking about things that will never happen  our life time Burn 
Michael Crichton has created another adventure masterpiece With the success of pictures like the Matrix, one can see this book being made into a movie  no time I purchased the book yesterday  finished  this  afternoon A very good adventure, totally absorbing  yet  provided an  insight into an era of history I had never paid much attention to I  extremely enjoyed the manner  which Crichton weaves Quantum Mechanical  concepts with the &quot;Fictional&quot; possibility of time travel Jules  Verne, Arthur C Clarke, Robert Heinlien  Edgar Rice Burroughs all  rolled into one
TIMELINE is outstanding, Crichton tells a story that brings together all the elements that made his thrillers so good  With wonderful characters  a fabulous storyline you will be unable to put the book down  Order   now sit down  enjoy!
Michael Crichton takes the &quot;what &quot; genre very seriously  he deserves admiration for challenging readers He does a lot of research,  his creations are often rooted  modern, cutting edge science The science   &quot;Timeline&quot; is a complicated combo of quantum physics   parallel computing Crichton understands this stuff, but the average reader  will feel about six college degrees of separation from   &quot;Timeline&quot; is filled with weak dialogue  vellum-thin  characters I couldn't help feeling that Crichton decided to let a  screenwriter flesh out the characters (He's already signed a landmark  movie deal for &quot;Timeline&quot;) The most interesting character is  medieval historian Andre Marek, a slab of Mensa beefcake with a jones for  jousting But, as interesting as he might be, his fate is highly  predictable The violent, medieval action takes place during a war that  actually happened, but repetition  predictability ultimately drain the  thrills Marek  company run around castles  mix  up with knights,  get separated  reteam, get thrown into dank cells  then escape  Meanwhile, the cast of British  French medieval characters spend most of  the book scheming  yelling The book's main modern-day villian receives  a punishment that actually makes the heroes look bad Crichton has a great  track record (I'm still a big fan of &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;),  but &quot;Timeline&quot; is about satisfying as watching armor rust
